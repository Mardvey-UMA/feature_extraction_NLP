Though the processor could have been better, but considering rest of the features offered I would say it's fine...

It's definitely not a gaming centric phone, you can play games, but it might stutter at max settings like in PUBG.

a great battery (lasts me a whole day on medium-heavy use) and
a good display...

positive,"Roka Akor Scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated Roka in London.
I attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day. Overall, I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi, and robata grilled tidbits. The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik.
I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe. This Japanese sake sommelier is London-based and the zuma-roka group sake trainer. They do have a fantastic sake selection. Easily the best in Scottsdale. She loved my sake brand I created with Midorikawa called Green River, and my low alcohol brand sake, Koide, as well.
They also have a great Italian Sommelier named Alessandro Marchesan, who is also based out of London. Too bad they are only loaner personnel from HQ in London.
The room is clean and beautiful with post modern Asian inspired lines. The staff is eager and young, but quite unskilled in refined service.  I am sure that will be a long cycle for the Roka management to fix. I have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday. She told me the service was ""shockingly bad."" She then reiterated that is was,  ""so bad that it was entertainingly bad!"" The food great and hopefully the service will match soon. Kanpai, Roka..kudos on your sake program.",2

If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :
O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious!

negative,"Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.
Cons:
1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.

2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.

3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.

Pros:
1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.

2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.

3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.",0

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.",0

The display of the phone only makes it worth the price, and one ui is also very very good, I have used color os, and miui before and i can say the one ui wouldn't disappoint you.

The battery life is above satisfactory, and I'm a really heavy user, so you can do the math.

The fingerprint reader is sadly average and not as fast as you would expect it to be.

And lastly the camera software of this phone sucks...front camera is decent but the rest is really really bad, i can say my 2years old oppo had better camera than this one, but that was a bit fixed with gcam mod which you can download if camera really matters to you that much.

Finally the performance will not disappoint you, it'll handle multitasking effortlessly.

I am being open-minded and starting this thing off with 5 stars.  

Minus one star for being a bit overpriced on the appetizer end.  I ordered onion rings at $8 per order.  Seriously, are 15 onion rings worth $8? 

Minus one star for not having any parking.  You have to park a couple of blocks away in the ghetto area to find a spot.  You will have 2-3 beggars asking you for change to and from your car.  There was a dude who wanted to wash my windows for money.  

Minus half a star for putting the gratuity on the bill and charging for it.  I hate that crap.  

Plus half a star for the waitresses who are dressed heavy metal-like wearing mid-riffs with the tramp stamp.  I always wanted to date chicks like that, but was ummm...to busy with umm....other chicks chasing me down.

Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.",2

The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the ""WBC"" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.

I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.

It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor... 

The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience..

positive,"A HUGE, Monstrous (5000 mAh) and lot of battery for little money. The biggest USP of the Galaxy M20 is its battery prowess and the handset can stay away from the charger for long. The Galaxy M20 from Samsung brings premium features to the middle class at an entry-level price.

The phone is quite unlike any of the earlier affordable phones from Samsung phones. At the back M20 features a polycarbonate back with a glossy finish, lending it a classy appeal.

Galaxy M20 features a TFT panel, the colour reproduction is pretty good, and so are the brightness levels. Harsh sunlight doesn't pose any issues as far as screen legibility is concerned. The screen is protected by a layer of Asahi's Dragontrail glass to keep scratches and minor nicks at bay.

The Galaxy M20 is the brand's first handset to come powered by Samsung's Exynos 7904 chipset, Infinity V Display with a panel measuring 6.3-inches and a full HD+ resolution making the visuals very crisp.

The Marvel phone ships with a pair of shooters on the rear. There is a dual-camera setup accompanied by an LED flash and an oblong-shaped fingerprint reader.
The combination is made up of a 13-megapixel f/1.9 shooter, a wide-angle sensor with a resolution of 5MP and an aperture of f/2.2. For selfies, the smartphone comes with an 8MP snapper. The colours are pleasing to the eyes and details are spot on as well, be it in the landscapes or close-up shots. It is also a dual-SIM smartphone.
It is packed with a good speaker which is paramount to enjoying multimedia on the go with a large screen and does a good job of offering loud and clear output. Overall it's a smooth experience. Samsung have a winner on its hands.",2

We walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.

The menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.

We ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. 

Our tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.

The tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy.

The next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is.   

So I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out.",0

positive,"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, ""how nice"", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.

So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a ""different"" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",2

2. Oxyzen OS - it was the prime reason why I switched from poco F1 to OnePlus and it certainly didn't disappoint. Absolute joy to use this device due to clean and almost stock andriod experience with nice customisations.
3. Speakers - The dual stereo speakers are of top notch quality and you will never use in maximum output and still it's more louder than other flagsip devices.
4. 90 hertz refresh rate - Another deal maker is this utterly smooth 90 hertz refresh rate which is the best thing in OnePlus devises. Use it to believe it.
5. Camera - Better than expected rear facing camera which produces crisp and detailed pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. Selfie camera are also good.
6. Screen and sensors - The fluid amoled screen is just a treat for the eyes. All the sensors are working blazingly fast like fingerprint sensor and face unlock but missing the ir blaster.

Cons: 1. Battery life - Battery life is not that great will last for a day in moderate use. But the warp charger will fill the juices blazingly fast so not a deal breaker.
2. Camera bump- although the design is solid and cool but there is a slight tilt when u keep the phone in flat surfaces due to the camera bump.

Overall an amazing and allrounder phone from OnePlus. Just close your eyes and buy if u want a premium device in mid range price.

There is either something fishy about Redmi Note 8 or the seller Darshita Electronics.
I received my phone a few days back (Neptune Blue 6+64). It had left over glue on the right top side of the screen rim. The same kind of glue was present on the volume rocker (pics attached).
Surprisingly seal on one side of the box was open while the other seal was intact. I had the unboxing video and raised a request for replacement. Technical inspection was done by Amazon Partner and the phone was okayed for replacement.

Today i received my replacement phone and the seals were intact but it has the same glue issue. (Pics attached)

I have bought several phones and many from Amazon as well too but this time its been a bad bad experience. There can be a QC error from Redmi once a while but certainly not in every phone. I seriously doubt the seller Darshita Electronics.",0

The facility is big and clean and very well kept. If you want to use the entire facility (the weights and machines) you have to sign up for a monthly contract. However, if you just want to take the yoga classes, you can buy them packages of ten classes. The ten classes can be used over any length of time. I like that because if I'm out of town or busy, my class package doesn't expire. I do wish they offered more class packages, like in groups of 25 or 50 classes, the the way At One Yoga used to do. Because typically the more classes you buy, the bigger the discount. 

The great majority of the yoga instructors from At One Yoga have come over to teach at LifePower. I've taken yoga classes in several places throughout the US and I think these yoga teachers are among the best in the country.",2

And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.

The tilapia tasted pretty muddy, even for tilapia. It was served with a really sweet, sticky, almost BBQ-style sauce.

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends.

Finally he explained the parking wasn't prepaid and I needed to pay in a order to get my car. He gave me a bit of an attitude as if I was refusing to pay. Dude, it's 12:30am, I just got off a long flight & didn't realize my fiancé didn't prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online. All this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said ""you pay at the desk"" instead of ""its at the front"" which is unclear and indirect. I think next time I go out of town ill try a different parking garage.",0

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  

Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.",2

Good thing is stock android the only thing I like it.

Amazon technician visited my place and found the camera problem. I requested Amazon to return this phone and would like to go with different phone. My expectation was different with this phone.

Amazon didn’t return it they just replaced it and I am not satisfied with this purchase. Amazon did to me when I am a almost 7 years old customer of Amazon. I told that I don’t want money, keep it in my account and I would like to go with different phone as this phone is not as I was expected.

Amazon customer executive didn’t find a way to help , instead of that they just said this is what we can do only replace with same phone. Still camera is not doing ... fingerprint is slow .. phone is slow ... but I am not going to complain again becoz they may check found the issue they will just replace which doesn’t make any sense.

Request to buyers ... please read the policy carefully when you bye anything from Amazon. I am customer of Amazon from US and was having the same mind set that if you didn’t like thing you can return and get the right one which you like, but this is not same in India. So be careful we may need to check physically in store before buying it online ... as you may stick with these policies and stuck with the things which you don’t like.",0

neutral,"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!

I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.

The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",1

positive,"Well its a down to earth honest review of OnePlus 7T after using it for one month. First thing this phone is made for single guys like me as it says ""Never Settle"" well just kidding. I replaced my old Samsung Galaxy A30 and decided to go for OnePlus for the first time. Well it paid off superbly. It is a real flagship killer at this price range and it makes Iphone and Samsung look bad to some extent. Coming to the performance its blazing fast with that sweet Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ processor and 8GB of ram. The fingerprint scanner is also super fast and well designed too. The fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate was something that the OnePlus first introduced it in the market and rest all other smartphone company just followed along the standards set by OnePlus on its flagship device. With 1 month of usage I found the following important pros:-

1) Blazing fast - do not worry about lags anymore.
2) Network connectivity with this phone is also superb as OnePlus claims it is due to the new processor that results in 15% faster network acquisition. Downloads are blazing fast on Airtel 4G
3)Oxygen OS v10 based on stock android 10 - the OS is clean with less junk and far better in performance than other OS by respective companies like MIUI, OneUI etc.
4)90 Hz Fluid AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution of 2400 X 1080 - Videos and games feel ever so smooth.
5) Gaming - its not a gaming centric phone by any extent like Asus ROG 2 but gets the job done and has even higher benchmark performance score than the ROG 2. The Adreno 640 GPU can handle the games at pretty high graphics setting @60 fps too.
6) The feature of Gestures makes life a hell lot of easier for me.
7) The UFS storage 3.0 makes copy and paste operations much more smoother and faster.
8) The 30T warp charger is just amazing. 0 to 70% in 30 mins and 0 to 100% in 50 mins.

Every smartphone however great will always have some cons these are:-

1)No 3.5mm headphone jack - OnePlus deliberality does this to cut costs so that it can pack up the phone on other features.
2) No SD card slot - when u have the UFS Storage 3.0 you dont really need a SD card slot. OnePlus claims it slows down the phone.
3) Battery - well larger battery doesn't always mean more screen time as seen in Google Pixel or even Iphone where battery is not very big but they have great power backup and screen time. Same is with OnePlus 3800 mAh can get the job done in most number of days but still feels a bit less when you are performing GPU intensive stuff for a long time like gaming.
4) Camera - the only thing this phone lags behind as compared to other smartphones in the same price range is the camera. OnePlus has failed to impress me with the Camera on this phone. At this price range they are only giving EIS and 2x zoom with only a 16MP front selfie camera. While taking broad daylight photos you may notice that the colour may be oversaturated to some extent( a red flower may appear pink in photos). Low light photos at night look superb though. If you are looking for a better camera phone then OnePlus 7T may not be your choice.
5) Notch design - Some people may like it some may not its your own personal preference. I personally do not like it because it obscures the display of some apps and videos.
6) No official IP rating :- well you are never sure when the phone may give up when it is exposed to water as there is no official IP rating. So use it carefully in rainy season especially. OnePlus says its next smartphones will all have official IP rating.",2

The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.

positive,"This phone is overall good for its camera quality, battery backup and its processor. Camera quality is great compared to other phones of this price range. Processor is very fast, as you can open up 4-5 apps in pop up window and the phone dosen't even lag a bit, not to mention gaming- smoothest gameplay you could ever get in this price range.
All that aside the best feature is its battery backup, with a full charge your phone will easily last about 2-3 days over its normal day to day usage.
Fast charging dosen't satisfy much as it takes around 2 hours to charge from 30-100%.
If you're ordering online, make sure to add to cart a tampered glass and back cover along with it, as these are not included in the box, also make sure its of good quality becausethe glass may brake if the phone hits the ground with the corner side.

I promise--there is nothing at all vain, hacky, narcissistic, overpriced or arrogant, whatsosever, about Tyson Crosby or his work.

Phoenix should consider itself fortunate to be home to such a phenomenally over-talented, artistic genius.  Big art cities like NYC, Chicago and LA would never be able to fully appreciate the photographic brilliance of the one, the only, the premier best photographer in the world-Tyson Crosby.

Humble, poetic and unpretentious as he may be, I can't argue with him. The fist time I saw a Tyson Crosbie image, I j!zzed in my pants. Really, his work is that good. For real. No joke. I'm serious. Totally serious.  I love his work so much, I want to marry a Tyson Crosby print.

We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu:
Apps:
Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese
Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm 
Pizza:
MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil 
MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese) 
ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios 
SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives 
BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula 
WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage 

Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I don't eat pork, so I couldn't sample them all, but I'd happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this.

Their house draft beer is also quite tasty!

Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They don't take reservations for smaller groups and I've heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!",2

The worst flagship phones that had weaker battery performance have resolved this issue, but I wonder why OnePlus did not see it as a concern. I have bought this 7T after having used Redmi Note 4 for 2 years; I have had premium smartphones in the past, such as iPhone 3Gs, 4, Samsung Note 3.

I am totally happy with the performance with the only cons being an average battery life.  Redmi's battery was overwhelmingly good with a decent performance.

I am using battery saver option during work so that I have enough juice left till I reach home. The Warp charger is a saviour.  With battery saver option, I am able to sail through the day to bedtime.

The call quality, speaker and signal reception are good even at basements and underground metro stations.

They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.

1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .

2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .

3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).

4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .

5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .

6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.

7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)

8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .

9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.

10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information ,  no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often ""install galaxy apps "" ad pops up very annoying .

11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you  buy Samsung Galaxy themes

12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.

13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).

14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .

15)  No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).

16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support .",0

negative,"I wouldn't give a penny more then 5000 RS for such stupid creation . I mean a branded phone ls can give you a lot more. I am not getting into the hi-tec reviews that many do but to make life simple.

If you use your phone for selfies then avoid this as the phone has bugs and software issues. Mi customer service is terrible which only adds to it. The camera has a huge lag and if u think I shud have checked the settings then let me tell u I have even googld enough to find solutions.

If you use hotspot then this phone will die in 3hrs flat.

The phone's battery is not great at all.

Screen is HD but even dumb phones consume much lesser battery for a good screen illumination whereas this crap requires u to set the screen brightness at Max. Mi probably thinks that u operate the phone in 25 hrs daylight

Ur what's app will be a nightmare if u want to send selfies images.

Synchronization is another issue which I am trying to solve

Overall avoid this phone.. I'm not even going to the lack of network connectivity , no audio jack, no SD card... Blah blah blah..

However, it took him 5 minutes to get our rice. 
Another waitress showed up and we thought things would go smoother. We asked for our bobas and her response was ""he's by himself and working on it"".  I didn't like this response considering we had already been there 20 minutes without any drinks we ordered.

The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad.

When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, I'm not sure) seems to hide from customers.

positive,"The phone specifications are definitely enticing especially for this price. The battery life seems accurate depending on your usage. However the fingerprint reader could've been better. The recognition is not the problem. What is bothersome is the fact that your finger takes a while to locate the lens when you aren't directly looking at it. This is because the lens does not protrude outward and hence becomes difficult to feel its location. It's not really a con once you get the hang of it. You can avoid this problem with a decent back cover that creates a significant depth to the lens, which in turn becomes easy for your finger to feel and locate it accurately. Apart from that the phone is a worthy purchase for its cost.",2

The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.,2

Purchased this phone on Aug 17th 2019.

Things I liked about this phone
1. The phone came with Android 9 pie out of the box (Yes, Android 9 Pre-installed) (Phone manufactured Aug 2019)
2. The display is simply awesome, amazing super AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution
3.  Battery! 5k mAh battery last 2 days on moderate to heavy use.
4. Phone is not heavy even with 5000 mah battery.
5. Always on Display in enabled on this device (Truly a great feature for me)
6. Dark screen mode is present.
7. Type C port.
8. 15W Fast charger present inside the box.
9. No hybrid slot (dedicated 2 sim and Mirco SD)
10. Triple rear camera.
11. Trust of big brand like Samsung, unlike cheap Chinese phones.
12 . Good RAM management , I worked seamlessly with 10 apps opened.
13. Processor is good for regular daily use, I do not play much games, those who want to play games they may look for better processor phones.

Things I think that could have been better:
1. Camera quality could have been better.
2. Glass back would have made the phone even more premium.
3. No headphone inside the box.

Overall a great purchase!

The staff also seemed nice enough when I was there.  I'm not sure what others were complaining about.  Overall, it's a decent place to play, and its location makes it ideal if you're meeting people from the other side of town.",2

positive,"Feeling a bit weary from a steady stream of travel, we decided to head over here for my favorite Rx, Pho.

A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp, pork and vermicelli, dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce, a dash of their house hot sauce(a tad more fire than the ""cock"" sauce) and we were off to  a fine start. I was feeling better already.

The Pho arrived, and the aromas were simply intoxicating. After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria, we dug in, adding the usual lime, cilantro, basil, sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce. Commence slurping.

The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors. Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture. My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly. I selected the special beef which included shank, brisket, tendon, tripe and meatball. Outstanding.

Service was with a smile, prompt and attentive. I honestly felt like I was sitting in someone's home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis. I do not think that Cyclo can compare, while good, this just seemed more authentic.",2

positive,"So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial.

But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot.

I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava. 

If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it?

The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless.

In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served.",2

Recently I went to a lunch with my bf, her sis and Ma on the fly for her b/day since her first choice failed to be open on a Sunday afternoon..... Not her fault their site said they would be open. Bastards shaking my fist in the air didn't update the site. 
D O U B L E Grrrrr! I suggested Zin since we were in the proximity. 
So this is my 3rd time at this place. While pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion. Note to your mother! Do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake. It's nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake. Having said that... I am a creme brulee fan so that may have been it's downfall. I was expecting greatness and fireworks etc. I got a really good vanilla shake though don't get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake. Don't market it as a creme brulee shake. How to improve it and bring a tear to my eye? Put a creme brulee hat on it. Gimmie the crunchy, sweet I'm looking for expect and demand. Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and it's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile. It is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie. Still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally. The banana cream pie shake is de-lish and the Zin burger a def go. If you want a healthy choice go for the Tuna also very good and served perfectly rare. Mmmmm mmmm good.",1

positive,"The phone is excellent for everyday use and performance wise.

Highlights:-

1. The camera performance is mind blowing, you will be amazed with the camera shots and night mode. The pictures barely need any after edits if you want to directly post on Instagram.
2. Charging is super fast. No complains, phone is ready for use in half n hour.
3. Overall performance, RAM management, storage speeds, oxygen OS, 90hz display is as usual very good. Refresh rate is definitely noticeable to me but it depends on person to person.

Some negatives:-

1. The slightly disappointing thing is the battery performance which is just average. It has improved quite a lot after recent updates but not extraordinary.
2. The display is awesome but it might appear too bright sometimes, need some sort of feature to lower the glare sometimes.
3. Fingerprint reader is fast but not the best finger detection.

positive,"The Goelet A.C. Beuf Community Center is located on 35th Ave. & Pinnacle Peak Road. This is an awesome community center with several ammenities including: classrooms, a gym/weightroom, indoor track, and dance/exercise room. 

The indoor track is free to walk and is air conditioned - bonus for those walkers who dread the summer heat.  Use of the gym is at a cost - I think around $60 for the year, so it's pretty inexpensive but the gym is pretty small.  

They offer a variety of fitness/dance classes, at a cost, including: aerobics, ballet, belly dance, kickboxing, pilates and yoga + many more.  They also offer specialty education classes including: oil painting, computers and spanish.  I have taken a few of the classes and they are pretty inexpensive and last for a few months at a time - either once or twice weekly. It seems that they offer a lot of classes and activities for kids and seniors as well. 

Other amenities include indoor basketball court, softball fields, soccer field, basketball and volleyball courts, playgrounds, and picnic areas.

It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.

The burgers were tasty, a nice size - not too big, not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun. 
The fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.

The atmosphere was fine, good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.

positive,"Simply put, this place rocks. CleanFreak has a TON of vacuums, a debugging station, and a fast, very efficient car wash. Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.

CleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?

I highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This 
saves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.

The one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.

Bring it on monsoons!",2

If you’re looking for a phone with big battery and good camera, Galaxy M30 is worth considering.

The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance?

Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal?

I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate?

I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. You're better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers.",0

This is my first phone of Vivo brand let's see pros & Cons ,
Pros -
1.Display- HD + display , cool experience while using , vivid colors  so decent display with 720 resolution , watching videos better experience.
2.Build - Quality is good , feel bulky , back cover should have been of better quality ,
3.Battery- 5000MAH produce best screen time , video playback for almost 10 hrs ,
For normal usage 1 day can lasts.
18 w fast charge make it impressive.
Cons - Big issue is Camera ,
Why compromised quality been provided ,
It's unfortunate.
Even though received 3 system  updades but no change in quality of pictures, especially selfy camera is not as per expectation.
Verdict- Budget phone , decent phone in this price range , only hitch is camera , otherwise looking at price point ...u can go for it",2

I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.

Still, they made it look nice on the inside (they have a drive thru!) and they even had a man playing his versions of classic rock songs on guitar which was nice. The Hostess was also our server and she was super nice (Go Erin!). 
When a girlfriend of mine and I walked in we saw the specials for the day and when I saw avocado curry I was sold since I'm addicted to avocados. We got the lettce wraps which was good (wish it didn't come with iceburg though) and got it simply because it came with I believe their sweet and sour sauce AND the peanut sauce. LOVE peanut sauce.
From what I saw, they had a full bar. Beer selection was good, nothing on tap though which makes me a sad panda. I had to order the thai tea which was very good and tried the thai coffee, also good.
Avocoda curry was amazing! Though when I got the bill I was sad to see that it cost $18... I understand that when they say it's the special, it means that they don't serve it on their everyday menu.
I'll most def be back, very good place!

1) The internet barely gets connected even though the signal is good.
2) I recharge data on only one of the SIM's and even set the data preference for that particular SIM, but the preference changes on its own and I end up losing balance from the other number as internet would be connected.
3) Calling on Skype sucks as the audio of the mike goes on mute by itself, only plugging the headphone jack out and putting it back in restores the audio.
4) The volume of the audio playing on the phone suddenly decreases and rebooting the phone restores it.
5) The audio starts playing from the mike at times, again only rebooting it solves the issue.

negative,"One star would be giving it a holiday gift!

For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.

My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. 

The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.
They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.
Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!

The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.

Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!

Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.
Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.

The space is very nice and open, and despite the decent size crowd, it didn't feel crowded. Our wait was less than 20 minutes and there is ample place to sit and have a drink while you wait. Now, I must say, I don't know that the required staff uniform is unattractive, but it does seem like an impromptu tennis match could break out any moment. 

The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better. The tacos were slightly overstuffed and rather difficult to eat as a result, but the taste was good (3 shells, as opposed to 2, with the same amount of taco insides would be better).

negative,"I ordered M20 on 12 2.19, M20-4bg+64 variant, got the mobile on 13.2.19 itself. I prefer M20 only for 2 reasons. Samsung had a good brand name and it have 5000mah battery.
But, it not fulfilled my desires.
After, 3 days of usage am writing this review.
I am a normal mobile user, for me
Battery draining very fast. Think about heavy users. And for regular game players.
It's not a fast charging it takes more than 3 hrs for 0 to 100%.
Coming to RAM for 4 GB ram it's not worth. Repeatedly am facing strucking problem. While shifting to other app or tab. While gaming, typing the text, while gaming, while sliding the Facebook pages etc... I can't explain in text what I have facing here. It's not too fast for the 4gb ram. Before this I used motog3 only2gb ram its v.good performance compare to this M20.
Mobile weight also heavy, handling in single hand also difficult.
Coming to display it looks good, but it have full display upto edges in left and right sides. So we can't hold the mobile closely in left and right sides. We need to hold bottom of the mobile only. For the given weight thought to hold for a long period.
Camera Ok. Finally, Ram, battery, processor not good.
Yesterday 16.2.19 I report this problem to Amazon customer care, to return M20 mobile. But, they directed to do the hard reset. What am asking is why I need to hard reset for my new mobile .? If it had a problem , just take return it. That's ur policy mentioned also. But they are not responding properly. Think over these all. And buy it.

The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one. Whatever the reason, it wasn't a happening thing. Hey, at least the salsa was tasty.",1

positive,"I took my 6-year-old son here for his first taste of frozen yogurt.  There is only one size of cup to choose from, and that is a little inconvenient.  You have to make sure you don't fill it to the top.  I had chocolate, and my son had a mix of cake batter, red velvet cake batter, and oreo.  They were all good.  In addition to those flavors, they had vanilla, tart, butterfinger, pomegranate, and a couple others I can't quite remember.  There were a lot of toppings to choose from.  Chocolate chip cookies, cut up moon pie, dark chocolate, white chocolate, and milk chocolate chips, karob chips, sugar free chocolate pieces, mochi, colored mochi, every crushed up candy bar you can imagine, lots of fruits, 4-5 different syrups, gummy bears, gummy worms, sour gummy twizzlers, gigantic marshmallows, and whipped cream.  There were many more things, but I can't quite remember them all.  It was the largest selection I've seen, but I'm pretty new to AZ and haven't had experience with that many frozen yogurt shops.  The employees were really helpful.  Everything was spotlessly clean, and the yogurt was really great.  We will be back.",2
positive,"Looks and build:
Samsung M30 has a smooth rounded finish on all four corners and a back panel that’s made completely of plastic, has thrown in a two-tone gradient finish on the back panel.

 DISPLAY :
Galaxy M30 has a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels. The colours on Galaxy M30’s display appear full and rich.
Galaxy M30 shares its Exynos 7904 chipset and its really smooth.

CAMERA:
About the camera of the Samsung Galaxy M30, comes with a 13MP rear-facing camera with LED flash with a secondary 5MP secondary camera with f/2.2 aperture and also a 5MP ultra-wide angle camera with 123-degree wide-angle lens but low light photography really sucks i should say. If you use the Wide Angle Camera the resolution of the picture is really low (The size of the image). Forget about zoom in, its not even clear even before zooming in.

Performance and Software:

M30's Exynos 7904 processor with two ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and six Cortex A-53 cores clocked at 1.6GHz is the only thing in the gadget that lacks behind. Qualcomm Snapdragon processors are better performers. Well if you are a PUBG lover and want to play PUBG in it please consider another mobile as this mobile's performance wasn't good enough while playing it.

Strengths:

Display: 6.4” Super AMOLED FHD+ Infinity U
Battery: 5000mAh | 15W Charger
Ultra Wide Camera: 13MP/f1.9 primary camera, a 5MP/f2.2 depth sensor and a 5MP ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123 degree field of view

Fast Charge
USB Type C

Weakness:

Gaming Performance

Not Water & Dust Resistant

Opportunities:

Improved Processor: The phone runs with Exynos 7904 which is already used in Galaxy M20. Doesn't feel like buying an upgraded phone.
Colors: Comes with only two colors. Gradation Blue and Gradation Black. Should have offered with more color options
Gorilla Glass

Threats:

Build Quality – Plastic: The phone has a plastic finish and doesn't look like a premium quality product

This is the best phone in this budget",2

Look past these few demerits, this phone's a budget gem with clean, bloatfree pure Android experience, really good cameras(the 48mp camera takes 12mp photos in normal mode and the photos are pretty good thanks to the imx586 lens which I guess is the flagship lens), good battery life(lasts me about 2 days of normal usage), smooth internet surfing and stuff. I don't have any practical use of the phone's speaker except for alarm, and it leads me to the fact that this phone's speaker is one of the best speakers I've had in any of my phones.

Out of the two times that I have been here, I have tried their fontina burger, the pesto chicken sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the garlic fries. The burger was delicious, the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection, and the fries were awesome (although, the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste). 

The only downside is that this place is always packed  (or at least the two times that I have been here).  It was featured on the Food Network, so I kind of knew that it was a popular place. But the funny thing is that I thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it wouldn't be bad, but I was wrong and the line was still out the door.  Also, I kind of wanted to try their milkshakes, but the line was way too long to get back into (sort of wish they had an express line for desserts).

Tacos Atoyac kept coming up so I decided to give it a try without reading all the reviews (was recovering from the cold a week before so did not want to do much reading) . It should not be bad if the reviews are all 4 and 5 stars. 

Came here on 12/23 evening close to 7pm.  Parked the car right in front and seemed no one was in there. It turned out they were closing early that night.  The menu was small and don't offer much explanation (I guess they figure everyone knows what's taco and burro) 

Place was clean but smelled like smoke when we walked in. 

Looking at the price, I figure the taco was small and confirmed with the big, tall white tattoo guy behind the cashier, so I know how many to order.  My parents wanted fish tacos (they only know Rubio's fish tacos and burritos *roll eyes*) and I ordered some al pastor and asada tacos.  Since I am from LA, I am spoiled with cheap, good tacos.  The ones from Tacos Atoyas was only a okay compare to the ones in LA.   Usually the tacos I have are overflow with meat, but these are only half way filled.  Taste was a okay too.  

They also ran out of beef tamale that night which my dad wanted to try.

With 6GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage powered by the octa core Exynos processor, this phone packs the punch. Samsung has entered the budget phone arena with a statement. The infinity display combined with the screen resolution makes it one of the best phones. RAM allows you to play around with multiple applications and gaming becomes even more easier with the combination of the Octa core processor.

One limitation which if taken care of would have made this phone even better is the speaker quality. Though the ATMOS system does provide incredible sound experience while using headphones, the speakers when allowed to prove themselves fail miserably. If you are giving a 6 inch display, please don't expect the users to limit themselves to watching & listening to videos only via headphones",2

Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.

Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.

Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.

Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!

positive,"After reading the other reviews, I thought perhaps I would weigh in - they seem to be all over the place.  The critics are correct that the decor seems dated.  To me, having grown up back east with this very sort of restaurant, it was charming.  The restaurant is particularly enjoyable to visit at night, when they turn on the lights in the garden.  

I enjoy the layout of the dining room, although I agree it is a 'cooler' experience to eat in the bar.  I guess some people could be offended that the staff sit down and eat in the bar when it is slow, but I'm not one of those people - I think it adds to the charm.  

I had a very late lunch yesterday - around 3 - thanks to an appointment that went on forever.  So we ended up heading to Riazzi's for a late dinner, around 8:30.  At that time of the evening, the dining room was closed., so we sat in the bar.

Their service is truly one of the strengths of this restaurant.  On this night, they were unusually attentive - even for them. The waters came out immediately upon sitting down, then they took your drink order - as it should be. Neither my iced tea or water ever got below half a glass.  This is something I occasionally find annoying at places where the staff draws a lot of attention to itself when they refill drinks - particularly when it interrupts the flow of conversation.  Not at Riazzi's - they are attentive but unobstrusive.  

Their bread is my favorite restaurant bread in the Valley - hands down. It is actually better than the Italian bread I grew up eating back east in Hartford, New York, Boston and Providence.  It's so good that I wish they had loaves available.  You have to possess a lot of discipline not to fill up on the bread.

The salad is as others have described it - traditional, but fresh.  

My favorite item on the menu is now listed under pizzas and described as a Spinach Pie.  This used to be listed under appetizers as the Grass Pie, but if you order a Grass Pie, they'll still know what you mean.  It is a cheeseless pizza with spinach and arrabiata sauce.  Confession:  I love all things arrabiata. But this combination here is perfect.  For about 1.50 (I can't recall the exact figure), they'll add mozzarella to it, but I've never done that because it is perfect as it.  

They bring you a healthy amount of tasty parmesan cheese, so you can always throw that on the Spinach Pie.

So, I had that. Outstanding as usual. My wife ordered the Penne Primavera, which was very good.  Last time I was there with my daughter, she had the penne with garlic and oil, which I thought was just superb.  Simple, but perfect for a garlic fan like me.  I have a feeling most folks skip over such an entree in favor of something more elaborate, but I recommend it.  

We didn't have an appetizer, and even though I wouldn't describe the portions as enormous, they were generous and neither of us could finish our entrees.

Is Riazzi's going to be sexy for the young, hip crowd?  Probably not, although it is romantic at night with their lights and sunken/elevated dining room, and has the 'cool' factor of the bar.  It totally hit my 'nostalgic for the east-coast Italian restaurant' needs.  

I just wish the service at most modestly-priced Valley eateries approached Riazzi's. You can get spoiled with the bread and service over here.",2

We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.",2

Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.  (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.

I don't love the Lodge as much for a prime time or late night spot...It gets a lot more expensive and a lot more crowded. Go for happy hour, order some cheese curds and a $3 Miller Lite and you're bound to have a good time.

positive,"Things which i want to tell everyone seriously-
1 It has no comparison with Sd660 but according to #AntutuScore comparison and as per my regular use it is matchable with Sd660 no doubt.
2 Battery will be only 33% consumed after 2hr of pubg playback with HD settings, it proves that it is beast in battery.
3 4k playback directly from youtube through chrome browser i will find best result without lag.. make sure ur internet speed must be high.
4 The best is SAmoled panel by samsung. All side viewing angles are best and contrast is awsome.
5 Screen to body ratio is not only acceptable whereas its perfect because u can enjoy any video and your daily apps with better screen size and space.
6 Dolby atmos gives u customization and total surround sound experience in ur regular headphones as well but if u have supported one then u cn get best sound experience.
7 widevine L1 certification gives u full Hd 1080p in prime video as well as netflix content access and seriously i am watching alot of series on netflix now a days in my galaxy m30 and its crystal clear with best contrast and colour quality.
8 The more u talk so u have camera because main sensor of 13 mp is perfect and can give u best shots in daylight as well as night shots with flash and 5 for depth sensing is in live focus gives u perfect edge detection. 5 mp wide angle has some lack of details but its acceptable in day condition and seriously it has acceptable camera and front camera has best in class because 16 mp in other brands will not provide u samsung like quality but its awsome and face unlock is very responsive even in dark place it works 200%.
8 finally its look and build quality is great because it has polycarbonate so its great and deservable because it feels like premium glass as all edges are round so u can use #Kapaver case cost of Rs. 599 on amazon because i m using this its very strong.
9. Exynos 7904 14nm technology will not disappoints u because its samsung's new mid range gen processor and it can handles every heavy thing in ur mobile and i am using this as my daily driver without a single lagg.

So ultimately u can buy this but switch for 6gb/128gb variant for future concern and in Rs17990 it has no match..
Do not go for negative reviews because everyone has something to say when any big brand launches things in their price brackets.

So choose with ur wise and experience the thing acc to heart.",2

neutral,"I agree with Rachel C. & Luciana L. on the parking situation and the logistics of the whole place.  Although I will probably go again because my kids do enjoy it and I was able to get the last paid parking spot (at 11am).  I have been to this event and others in downtown Glendale and they can't handle the volume of people that go to these things.  Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....

She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals.

This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. 

Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.  

Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two..",2

The first few batches of items I brought in came out great, but then the quality started to go downhill.

Because of all this even after my dad's birthday he is using his same old phone.

the phone starts lagging again and again. touch screen not working properly. Lags almost twice or thrice in a couple of hours. same problem even in safe mode. Samsung not taking responsibility because it was purchased from here. not ready to provide written mail on that too. Visiting service center doesn't guarantee any data loss.

Superb quality of camera and phone.
Overall superb android phone from My favourite Xiaomi... MI",2
positive,"I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.
Pros:
Firstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.
My S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.
Android 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.

Cons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.
Secondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.
Fingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.

Overall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.",2

Face unlock feature is very fast and accurate too.

Cons

Samsung's OS features like searching lags a bit.
Flash light is not so powerful and hence low light photographs are not good.

neutral,"I went ahead with this product because it was associated with android one program and had a decent battery life. After 2 weeks of usage, this is the summary.

1. Great battery life:(8.5/10)
  I can easily get a day and a half to two days on this guy. I do a bit of gaming, YouTube, social media. Games run smooth, you don't have to worry about the SD 665. I bought the 18W charger( the charger in unit is 10W) and I wasn't satisfied. It takes 2 hours to full charge. It's acceptable because the battery is a massive 4000 mAh but I expected more from the charger.

2. Display:(7/10)
  Coming from a 1080p phone, I am not disappointed. WE REALLY CANT DISTINGUISH A 720p PANEL FROM A 1080p. If that's your deal-breaker, don't worry. Under normal conditions, the display is beautiful. A bit saturated, but you get used to it quickly. However, it's not the brightest panel and under the sun, it can get really dim. Also, in dark conditions, it is brighter. Another thing I noticed is that the auto brightness sensor is not great, it can get brighter than needed to be or dimmer.

3. Software:(9/10)
  Android one, need I say more? Android 9 is great, and I have got a couple of security updates, so far so good. Everything is very smooth and seamless, although android 10 hasn't dropped yet.

4. Camera:(8/10)
  It's a surprise! The normal lens, 2x lens can take some very good photos for this segment. The wide angle lens gives you options, but you can't expect good detail. The night mode is better than nothing, but that's all is there to say about it.

5. Gaming:(7.5/10)
  Games run good. No lag, no heating issues. Although, this phone isn't optimised for gaming.

5. Other stuff:(5/10)
  The auto brightness sensor is a bit of a let-down. The auto-rotate sucks. It gets pretty annoying while watching YouTube. Unlike other mi devices, this doesn't have the infrared sensor. I have mixed reactions about the speaker. It is loud, but gets blurry, so I always have to go down 2 points. The haptic feedback was a sweet surprise! Feels very good. The fingerprint sensor is slow, and misses a few. I thought it will be bearable, but it gets annoying coming from a physical fingerprint sensor. And face unlock is just a gimmick.

Overall, I am satisfied with the product but if you can push up your budget a little, there are lot of better options available. Or, if you could hang with your phone for some more time, do so. Or, if you don't really mind the software experience, you have better options available.

They have been open for 8 years and have had a pretty steady following.  There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?

Apparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.  

So after dinner, catfish, PORK CHOPS TO DIE FOR!! So tender, fried hot wings, mac 'n cheese, mashed potatoes, LOTS AND LOTS of hot sauce, we heard the band start warming up.   YES!!  GREAT music.

I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good.  I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria, but there really is not - it was great food, great service and fun for the kids (there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too (so the parents can enjoy their food too)

My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too, and she said it was really tasty too.  She loved it.  The desserts were amazing too, and very filling --- SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY!

negative,"I'm torn with Cream. I've been to the usual clubs and lounges in Scottsdale enough to be sick of them, and Cream was something new. I like that Cream is emulating Vegas-style nightclubs, but it's obviously trying too hard.

The decor:

First of all, this place is PAINFULLY tiny. I've only been here once, and while it was half full, so it wasn't completely unbearable. But I can't imagine what it must be like when they have guest DJs and other performers in. A tiny place that's packed isn't popular. It's just... small.

The walls are covered in white (leather?), the tiles are white, everything is white - I get it, white like Cream? I appreciate the commitment to the color but the theme is waaay off. The hard surfaces make the place look cold and very hospital like - I would have liked to see more smooth lines and softness in the design, more flowy like cream.

The atmosphere:

The dig the loud music and the techno. I get so sick of hearing the same stupid songs on the radio. I love the change in scene. Phoenix/Scottsdale is so stale in terms of music. This is a nice change. But it's too loud when you can't even put an order in for your drink. I literally had to pull myself onto the bar (I'm tiny, 5'3"") so I could give my order directly into the bartender's ear.

They also had a really cool entertainment act - a girl hung from a hoop suspended from the ceiling wearing a white bikini. She was clearly talented in her hoop manipulating and was mesmerizing to watch, but like I said, this place is TINY, and there were several instances in which she was inches away from kicking people in the face. And THAT would have been worth the ridiculous cover I didn't pay (I try to find any way not to.)

The drinks: 

Overpriced and terrible. Maybe the bartender THOUGHT she heard me say I wanted a glass of vodka piss, because that's what it tasted like.

I doubt there will be any improvements made that will make me like Cream better, but here's hoping.",0

neutral,"Don't fall for the advertisements which I did, thinking that Samsung in trying hard to do good in this price segment with so many features at this price-point. Let's see the pros and cons and I shall leave the rest to you...

Pros: Now that I have started to write the plus points I find that this phone doesn't have anything exceptional to offer at this price point which other manufacturers like Huewi, Mi, Realme are not offering.  Full screen 6.3 inch with teardrop notch, Dual Camera, 5000mAh battery, fast charging with usb type-C, Low radiation are the plus points much touted by Samsung.

Cons:
1. Dual camera system is a complete joke. 13 MP primary camera is just average. 5 MP wide angle captures are grainy. Lowlight capabilities are minimal. Pro mode is another joke.
2. Phone heats up considerably when playing games like PUBG
3. For a 5000 mAh battery day to day performance is rather poor. Lasts only a day on more than average use, which other phones last with 3500mAh battery.
4. Fast charging is not fast at all, requires more than 2 hrs to charge fully.
5. Fingerprint sensor feels like still in its fast generation. Slow, inappropriate, problematic. Face unlock is another disappointment.

And the primary rear camera is a 13-megapixel unit with an f/1.9 aperture, while the secondary camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and 120 degree field of view. The front camera has an 8-megapixel resolution that provides excellent photos.

I didn't have any trouble using the Samsung Galaxy M20 for day-to-day tasks. Apps and light games ran without any trouble, and i multitasked quite heavily too.The screen is bright and crisp, with good viewing angles. Videos looked good and games including.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

positive,"So had to choose between this phone and the rog2. Both are excellent phones and was a tough choice. Flipkart having less availability of rog2 made the choice easier in the end :) moreover, one plus is now a trusted brand name so that helps. Its pros - lighter, trustworthy brand, quicker charging speed, more professional look, better camera, macro lens!
Cons - 3800mah battery compared to 6k mah of rog2. Did not expect the phone's battery to really last more than 12 hours, which is fine since we all charge at night atleast, however to my surprise it's been lasting for more than a day!
Plus the warp charge is indeed as good as marketed, got around 75% in half hour from 1%.
The fingerprint reader and camera are very good, having no issues. The 90hz refresh rate is probably just a new marketing thing to attract better prices. Even an above average user won't notice it. Not sure what 1 has to do to even notice it lol. The screen quality is awesome indeed though.
Hope these details help.",2

We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didn't contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot. 

Probably my most memorable hike thus far.",2

positive,"Ahhh.... Whole Foods, John Mackey's little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry. I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok I'll cut this short.

This Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more ""quaint"" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance ""browsing""; this makes my girlfriend very angry.

I don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it. 

One last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their ""surfboard"" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99. This may be the best deal going at Whole Foods and make up for that $8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought.",2

Happy that I got what I expected.
I am giving 4 star for now as I have to check if this phone has a heating issue or not and I will change it to 5 once I am satisfied.

Overall a great product at this price, Go for it 👍

Great quick lunch options. I'm a big fan of the lunch salads.  They are very filling (paired with the free chips and salsa!!)  My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Salad (Mixed lettuce, black beans, roasted corn, cheese mix, pico de gallo topped with grilled chicken)-- it's only $6.99.  The spunky chipotle dressing is delish.  There are also several lunch-sized versions of dinner plates available for diners looking for a heartier meal.  The service is always friendly and were are able to get in and out in less than an hour, which is very convenient during a busy work day.",2

negative,"Worst camera.
Leave about 48MP, after looking at the pics(in mobile, not PC/laptop) you will feel like pictures were taken from some kind of 2MP or age-old 8MP camera. The battery is good but not up to the mark, for 6000mah you would expect it to last for minimum 2 days at least with basic usage(no movies/games/heavy browsing etc..) like calls and checking notifications, messaging, etc. It lasted for just 28 hours for me with basic usage. Charging time was around 3hrs.

Wifi coverage is also limited. It doesn't connect if I am in different room which was not the case with real me and One Plus phone.

The only best thing is the display. I think this mobile has got the best display under 15K range. If your only priority is display then nothing can beat this mobile under 15K.

And the worst part is that there is no replacement for this mobile, only refund. I believe replacement was not given considering the additional 1000 cashback which will be credited to the seller if they refund the amount, not sure though. Seller - STPL Exclusive Online.",0

negative,"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.",0

Best for gaming Mediatech Helio processor just fantastic. Even though having a Liquid cooling system it have a bit heating issue but not overheating but compared to Pocco F1 it's a bit hot I'm a YouTube content creator. So i use all this phone. If having a bit more budget will suggest to go for Redmi K20 pro Realme X2. Or if looking for a gaming phone go for Asus Rog phone 2. Best tuung is that we are having a Hand free Alexa It's so nice that we can access Alexa by saying ""Alexa"" and Als use Google Assistant at the same time which is not available for any other phone of this range. The only Thing A back draw is its display and the water notch display. It's so tempting that it's just having a led IPS Display. By the way anything can't be perfect. Not that good as Pocco F1 if anyone using Pocco F1 better don't change it. Never go for phone saying 64 MP 108 MP etc because not just Megapixel which matter the picture quality. It has a great photo precision. If it found helpful please follow me and Click of the ""helpful"".",2

I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he ""got lost.""  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was ""eh.""

they do all their own importing, and buy, sell and trade jewelry. i felt he was very honest about my ring, the cash value he stated was in line with numbers i heard from other jewelers and he was charming and helpful, answering questions and educating me while i ogled over diamonds and pearls. i will return to have my watch batteries replaced, a pair of earrings changed from yellow to white gold, and pretty much anything else i can think of. i trusted him immediately, which, when dealing with diamonds, is of paramount importance to me.",2

They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed.

- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast
- The display is very good
- Build is nice

CONS
- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)
- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.

Let's begin with it's form. Looks like a 5 year old design.

Interface - from the thick ancient font to silly round folders, this one looks like the first generation smartphone. Even Taking a screenshot is such a tedious task.

Camera - Mega pixels is a farce. There is hardly any pixel depth. You can't even zoom in 10% on the photo you've taken. The quality of image sucks. Finding focus is another issue. Image correction has limited tools.

From a non functional fm radio to low ability to capture signals amd internet, i am yet to find one good thing about this phone.

Please please go for the redmi note series if you arr confused between the two. My sister has one. The tech reviewers should be sp@#*&ed for recommending this over Note pro 7.

Display is excellent  - one of the best I've come across.

In my opinion, the battery life is not as great as the marker has made it out to be. It is not bad, either. Phone can last for a day if the usage is average to above average.

Camera is very strange - it clicks nice pictures and has a lot of options. But, the pictures are not high definition  and lose out on clarity (something that can be easily seen if you zoom in on any clicked picture : appear extremely pixelated).

Speakers are decent.

Facial recognition is not good. It is too slow in well-lit areas and doesn't work at all in areas with low-light even if I put the backlight function on.

Fingerprint reader is decent. Works most of the time. Suffers from the prevalent problem in almost all readers - doesn't work if fingers are even a little bit sweaty/dirty.",1

I am using vivo phone for first time and yes, it doesn't disappointed me.
-The processor in it is really awesome even it is better than your expectations.
Some of SD-675 doesn't contain with Kerin 460 ,but it has which provides you more smoothness for running apps.
-4gb ram with 64gb internal storage is a nice combination for daily tasks and running games.
-others competitive phones in this price segment can't beat this U20 model in accordance with the quick service. It's more
Quick because it has UFS-2 , which is more quick then EMM chip.
- camera with bokeh mode is genuine.
Others lenses are pretty good.
- box contain with a 18W fast charger which takes max 2hous to take full charge.
- a simple screen guard applied on the phone screen .
- Battery is big .
- Google assistant response quick.

Pros⏺️

▶️ Big 5000mah battery

▶️ 18w fast charging

▶️ Big screen 6.35 inch

▶️ Triple rear camera

▶️ Snapdragon 660 pro

Cons⏺️

✔️ Rear camera 8mp is not so good. Actually its below the average in low light nd average in day light

✔️ Micro usb port am not a fan of type c
But some people dont like micro usb

So overall a good product.
If u want a big battery phone nd camera doesn't matter that much for uhh so u can buy this.

positive,"My mom and my son and I went to old town on a Thursday to check out some galleries and listen to some of the buskers! So after our perusing we stopped to get ice cream. 

Real ice cream! Petersen's is a really cool place and it's brand new! Just opened 11/23 I think. Well they have lots of great flavors like Georgia Peach, NY Black Cherry, Cappuccino, Peppermint with real peppermint, lots of sorbet, lots of chocolate stuff that I didn't want to try, and old favs like cookie dough, butter pecan etc. 

They also sell pints and also gallons I think! 

The staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop. I think the girl said they originated in Chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location! I just thought that was so cool! She also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors! I thought that was pretty rad. 

Anyway, if you are in old town I highly recomend you check this place out!",2

negative,I am writing this review after 2 months of usage of samsung M20. I always buy midrange phones 10 to 14k but this worst . Trust me guys. And if you are mi user u would be dissatisfied big time. Few bad things i want tell - fingerprint does not work even if youch 4-5 times and it does not have vibration on fingerprint . No vibration on keyboard. Dual camera but no good blur effect. And worst part is that if you stand 2meater from camera facing camera then only it can create blur . If want to click object or if more than 1 person . It does not detect properly. Looks fake blurr. Front camera is also worst.  I would say worst cameraa of the segment. Dont buy samsung mid range phone. Its bad even after softwareupdate. Few more things . Watch any youtube review about m20 for more bad things. I line suggestion dont buy M series. This might be another reason its not availble on shops.,0

Radiation this is the worst problem in all three  cellphones which i already used they r giving better cameras,better battery life etc etc
But no improving problem of radiation
But, but in samsung which I'm currently using i didn't see any sign of radiation problems such as headache, eye start burning after long use,no sweat on the screen while talking for long time,not very much heating while gaming,this is also the things one should know about all problems like this while planning to buy a good cellphones,bcoz we have to take care of our health n I'm suggesting to buy Samsung cellphones bcoz i think they know very well about human nature n what things is positive n negative for cellusers,

positive,"The burgers here are pretty average.  Thin, flat, kind-of greasy patties with lettuce and tomato.  But what sets this place apart is their other offerings.  My husband got the tri-tip steak sandwich and he said that it was delicious.  The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly.  I loved the fact that they serve sweet potatoes fries.  Those have become very popular lately but this is the only fast food place I know of that has them.    The ones I tried were cooked perfectly and very lightly salted.  The onion rings were also cooked just right with no soggy pieces.  I thought that the batter to onion ratio was slighly scewed toward the former but my hubby thought they were perfect.  Their regular fries are also very good.  I tried the chocolate shake and it was really yummy too.  I think its great that you can get a veggie burger here as well as a tuna steak sandwich.  The extra toppings they offer such as sauteed mushrooms, avacado, and teriyaki and BBQ sauce are all a big plus as well.

The decor is simple since it is a fast food joint.  The booths were big and comfy and the faux leather looked slightly more upscale than you would expect.  We went on opening day so the service was phenominal.  We didn't have to wait long for our order and everything was to our specifications.  Servers came by serveral times to pick up trash and offer to refill our drinks.  The restroom was very small but clean. I try not to eat fast food too often but I will consider coming back next time I am craving a burger.  Or maybe I'll give one of their salads a try.  They earned a repeat visit from me and an extra star since they donated 100% of their opening day profits to Phoenix Children's Hospital.  A big thanks to Sarah S for posting that on Yelp events page so that we could contribute... and fill our bellies!",2

I don't like other android phones due it's UI, love stock android.
Camara is awesome especially the macro mode

I was expecting great battery but its still its good as compared to 3T amd iphone cameras

As i moved from 3T to 7T, I had to buy the type C jack which was a little frustrating

Coming on to features
Design - 4/5

Performance - 5/5
+Latest and greatest hardware
+Smart optimisations

OS - 4.5/5

+Fastest charging ever seen
+Slight less capacity

Camera -4/5
+Overall good output with all 3 cameras
+ Amazing macro mode
- Misses details and messes up with Colors sometimes

Audio - 4/5
+Clear and loud - quality output

CONS
NO Headset jack. Had to buy as mentioned above
One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.
Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 )

I received One Plus 7T 20 days back and i am describing you my experience after 20 days.

Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.

Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.

The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%. am among the first to buy this phone without prime membership.

Posting this review after 4 weeks of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good.

There is no lagging issue till now.

The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first.

Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit.

Speakers are loud and produce decent sound. Haven't checked the selfie camera and the video recording till now.

Thanks Amazon and OnePlus",2
neutral,Sim signal receiver not good compared with other phones. The same sim i used in S8 was good but in M30s it is comparatively poor,1
positive,"I have to replace my current Pixel phone as it had become too sluggish. I loved Pixel's camera and was planning to buy Pixel 4 but alas it didn't launch in India. So I wanted to check for other phones and decided to reduce the budget of the phone. I wanted a decent camera, UI close to stock android and a good camera. I have used OnePlus2 before so I decided to go for the latest OnePlus 7t and its a fabulous Phone for this price range.

PROS
- Awesome camera (not pixel but very good)
- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast
- The display is very good
- Build is nice

CONS
- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)
- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.

Also,  the screen has developed a white coloured area along its borders where the sensitivity is almost zero: Can't type 0 or p any more using my favourite keyboard,(typing this using Samsung's crappy keyboard which places both letters slightly differently. But it delivers two p's instead of one). A visible scratch like mark is developed in the bottom right corner of display (beneath the screen). GPS is faulty. Camera is below average and it can't handle low light despite the claim.

positive,"This place hits everything on my ""it's Awesome"" list. 
First off it's a family run little place.
Second it's in a hole in the wall area.
Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house. 
Fourtherly it is awesome

We were in Gilbert staying at a friend's house for spring training, GO DODGERS!!! We hit the usuals, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts, Dodger Dogs at the game, and our friends asked do you like sandwiches?
If there is one food group that I love, it has to be the Sandwich group, and 
this place is one of my top 5 sandwiches stops of all time.

We ate in the Lounge(y)(ie) area, which has a more adult vibe going on. We first started with their fresh bread, and tomato basalmic vinegar salsa(y) thing. Which was great, we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages, and waited on our sandwiches.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad, and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich, with pasta salad. My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork. 

I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes. While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me.

Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me. This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on.

After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream. Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect. In fact I am planning another trip out that way, just for that ice cream.",2

negative,"We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as ""he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it.""  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these ""stupid"" machines.  After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services.

Feedback

feedback
-People say camera but I find it's too good.
-People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud and clear enough.
-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43

After Using for 1 week

positive,"4.5 Stars... I really enjoyed Beckett's table! It's a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard they're planning to build a large patio on the side of the building. 

I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items: 

The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing! 

We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste. 

The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside. 

The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friend's short rib - very tender and lean. 

We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now. 

Overall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion.",2

positive,"The main reason for the four stars is for their Angus Roast Beef Dip -- it is delicious!  It is up there on my list of favorite French Dips. The meat is super tender and juicy, and the horseradish spread really compliments the sandwich. Plus, it is a great condiment to dip your french fries in.  

The portions are huge -- my sister ordered the Sesame Chicken Salad and she barely ate half of it. I, of course, devoured my sandwich. They have a huge menu, with a lot to choose from. They seem to be known for their pizzas, which look really yummy too.

The atmosphere is similar to most sports bars, although I'd say this place is more of a ""high-end"" sports bar with chandeliers and mood lighting instead of ripped vinyl and dirty blinds.  There is a massive flat screen TV. above the bar, and little ones interspersed throughout the restaurant. The wait can be a bit long on Friday nights and weekends, but you can call ahead to get your name on the wait list.  And, they are nice enough to offer you some small pizza bites while you wait.

Overall, BJ's is your standard chain restaurant/sports bar, but with a few extra niceties to make it stand out above the rest.  I'll be back for sure, and maybe next time I'll venture outside my love-for-the-french-dip and try some of their other goodies.",2

neutral,"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.",1

positive,"Amazing phone at the budget of ₹15000

Pros
- You get a good battery backup of 24hour+ (if you don't play game and use mobile for normal usage and internet)
- Phone does not lag while you play game
- Superb Video quality
- Design is very beautiful (gamma green)
- Camera Quality is just wow with 64 mp camera plus you get lot of other camera features and good photo quality even in low light.
- Finger print scanner response is very quick
- Quick Charge
- You can insert SD card as well as 2 sims
- No heating problem felt even while playing game for an hour

Cons
- Alexa does not respond quickly. Instead Google assistant is amazing
- Screen size is big so using with one hand will be a problem
- Phone is 200g so i will feel heavy if you hold the phone with one hand and watch video.
- Low light and zoomed clicked photo is not good
- Pre installed useless MI apps keeps poping up ads. Well you can disable that.

Overall, I loved this phone at the price. Camera is amazing in day light. Quick charge solves my problem and a good design.

neutral,"Despite being heavy in RAM and good processor speed, the phone has heavy lagging issue. I was unable to install even whatsapp for first 1 hour and when finally it was installed, it kept on crashing every 10 minutes. Forget about restoring the backup on the apps, even newly installed app had trouble running. Don't know it was the problem with my phone in particular or with m20 series in general but despite trying to make it work for 24 hours, I had to finally return it. Thanks to amazon that it was returned promptly, though I am yet waiting for return of my money since last 2 days. I was using moto g 4 earlier and despite having only 2gb RAM, moto was much faster than m20 which has 4 gb RAM. Is it because of heavy and RAM intensive customizations done by samsung, that only samsung will be able to tell. If samsung really want to compete with xiomi, they should better work less on the android customization and any customization should be optional rather than putting load on phone in the form of bloat ware. If it is not because of customization, then they should verify the supplier of their hardware whether declared specifications are actually usable. Anyhow, not at all satisfied with Samsung m20.",1

negative,"I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.
It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....

I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.

First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:
1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??
2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.
3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.

At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?
Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.

I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.
WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.

At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!

Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea

I haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!

4. 90Hz screen is classy, crisp and bright. That is a different experience you have to try it to understand. On the other hand for 90Hz display, battery gets affected.

5. For moderate users, Battery life is good for 1day usage(Over 6hrs screen on time).. But need one dedicated update for battery improvement. 30T wrap charger charges fron 20% to 100%  in 45mins.

Need software updates for:
1. Selfie camera photo quality

It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.

They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do.

The wait staff saw my confusion and quickly reassured me that the name and menu had slightly changed but the food was basically the same. I had the curry fish last time and was craving it so I tried it again and yes, still absolutely delicious. Tried the calamari and crab wontons as appetizers. The calamri was solid but the crab wontons were only okay. A little too fried and in a skin that didn't feel like wonton skin. The curries that came to our table looked pretty neutral colored and the noodle dishes, instead of being on the red side or the dark brown side was also very neutral colored. Since I didn't taste those dishes, I can't legitimately penalize the restaurant but I have to admit that I hesitate to order anything else besides the fish because of their appearance. I'm still going to give this place 4 stars because of the taste of the food I ordered, the good service and the fact they had brown rice as an option. If ever I'm brave enough to stray off the path, my rating may change. But in the meantime, check this place out and order the curry fish on their specialties menu. I ordered it level 4 - hot and it was just the right amount of heat.",2

negative,"Back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here.  I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.",0

We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! 

I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!

The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too.

Although I have to say I was expecting a big box which had some extra goodies, like the many youtubers (including Indian ) had been showing. I would suggest OnePlus to at least include them as a part of a deal. Any way once I started using the phone, all my complaints started fading away. That 90 Hz display gives a butter smooth touch experience.

2 days usage Update:
*About the big box goodies mentioned in previous review above, they are available on OnePlus portal. So be ready to shell out money for the same.
*camera is not in the league of iphone 11 or Galaxy Note 10 or even Pixel 3 but it ain't that bad either. But Macro mode is a big saviour.
*Display is definitely the best part of the phone, along with the processor SD 855+
*Stereo Speakers can be pretty loud and clear
*Battery is again not as good as iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10+ but it would be enough for a day's usage. And why worry much when we have warp 30T charger
*I wish they could have included at least USB Type C Bullet earphones.

positive,"Strolled in with a posse of 14 people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.

First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.

In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef ""medium"" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.

For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. 

The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees....",2

Camera - (Check the image clarity & crisp on the attached above image taken from M30 Autofocus mode) Average good color saturation and focus even Bookeh effect and Palm jesture options. This quality is more than enough for a daily or often usage. Don't expect a DSLR out of it ha ha ha.
Battery - Huge backup to run for more than a day. Thanks to SuperAmoled display
Processor - Ultra clock speed. Exynos is doing its job. As I played PUBG the most advanced graphic & RAM tester game ever made.
Design - Super cool & young generation style. Gradation look is something Unique from Samsung.
Sound/Audio - Dolby Atmos what more u want. Sitting in the crowded cab felt like Theatre Dolby experience crisp and clear+DUAL Sound effect of background+vocal speech in less volume you can hear all the details which I was missing in other smartphones till date. Even the Headphones earphones and also Speaker volume also too good due to Dolby Atmos sound engineering becos of this I felt comfortable in watching a movie over the Speaker which I never used with other smartphones till date used so far. The Bass of the Speaker u can feel it and on high volume also its not getting break.
Display - A unique MASSIVE FHD SuperAmoled on 6.4 inchs display (good battery saver known fact)
This M30 is Highly recommended. Buy and experience its magic performance then u will surely find my reviews true. Go for it don't think back!!!!  Thanks Amazon for fast delivery and the Seller for delivering me in a Good package. Buy today and experience smooth silky speed of Samsung M30.",2

1. worst proximity sensor.phone blinks during call
2. No LED indication during charging.
3.No option to mute camera flick sound other than muting media.
4. If you are using earphones while taking call, it irritates. You will not get any option to lock the phone so that you can keep mobile and pocket and speak with earphones. I have removed power button option  to end call so that I can lock the phone and keep it in the pocket while using earphones.  Now there is no touch protection such that my phone speaker option gets pressed. call goes to mute.. it literally irritates. Even during normal time when phone is in pocket,Emergency numbers get dialed, camera turns on.  I really feel Lejovo K4 which j used from 2016 has better geatures than this.
5. Touch is so poor that you need to touch couples of times to open something or when disconnecting the call(not always).
6. Coming to the body of phone, while speaking in phone, the voice vibrations are felt in the real panel which irritates throughout the call.
7. I felt my old phone Lenovo  k4 which released 4 yrs back has more features  than this.

here are some of  the pros and cons
pros:
quick charge 4/5
battery life 4/5
camera 4.5/5
audio 4/5
bluetooth connectivity 4/5

cons :
stability 3.5/5 (was trying to update status on whatsapp app but every time it tried , phone was going back to home screen , did reboot the device but still same for had to wait for some time and the n turned device off and on then was able to us whatspp , also at the second day of use phone was lagging while normal use . didnt expect that on second day lol.)
night mode :3/5 ( i use night mode all the time, so after enabling night mode every time i unlock the phone , it goes to normal mode and then night mode , kinda annoying )
finger print :3.5/5 ( phone fails to detect finger for 2 out of 10 times so pretty annoying ).
notification drawer : when we use the phone from good coverage to low coverage phone still shows volte icon, even though the phone is not on 4g cause i have to turn on and off the airplane mode to find out that phone is on 2g or phone data icon is crossed .

Over all i m happy to use the phone but still this is first month of the use so cant say much .

negative,"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. 

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!",0

On my behalf my brother received the product since I was out of town.

it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.

i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.

after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.

The salad bar is so old school, it still has jello - not jello shots - jello.  And since, I'm old school, I'm a fan of the salad bar.

Monday 4 buck burgers with 2.50 salad bar is the only food you'll require for the whole day.  Decent burger too.

Good barkeeps - they remember your name or call you hon (old school).

The food is pretty basic, but they start with decent ingredients and prepare them well.  Had the prime rib a couple of weeks ago and my view is that the only way to eat prime rib is to have it breath it's last on the way from the kitchen to the table.  It was early enough in the evening that they were able to deliver a tasty hunk of meat that was as requested.

My friends and I stayed downstairs for the majority of the night. The hip hop music was pretty good and the DJ had a excellent music selection.

Then she came back with another beer that I didn't order, and I think she got a little pissed because she misunderstood me. At the end of the night, I asked for some water and she only gave me a bottle instead of just a cup of tap water and charged me $2. Don't be a hater lady!!

GET A SHOT OF CAFE PATRON!!! If you like coffee and patron, it's literally the best of both worlds. And, to top it all off, they are only $3 A SHOT!! Very reasonably priced. I had 3 within a span of an hour (I'm a heavyweight so I wouldn't recommend that for everyone!)

The Bobbie, which is made of freshly roasted turkey (I've seen the big hunks that didn't get chopped), cranberry sauce, stuffing and a hint of mayo is fabulous!
The capastrami is a delightful combination of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw, and wonderful in taste.
You can choose the size of sandwich you want, as well!
Capriotti's also has salads, and a host of other sandwhich selections, which are consistently delicious and fresh.

negative,"IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.

The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.

[update April 2, 2011]

Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.

My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.

My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate. 

Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)

Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.

The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.",0

5.Then advised to press power button + volume down button (Factory data reset) till 20- 30 sec but no responding.
6.Finally i decide to go for replacement, at that time i realize  there is no replacement as becoz its out of stock(Not sure the reason).
7.For a last chance i just press Power button+ Volume up button god grace its restarted at the time and the issue cleared. But not sure which is due to the OS updation and all and don't know whether issue came again or not.

negative,"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.

I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.

Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.

Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.

I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.

All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time.",0

I have bought this against all my friends advise who had very bad experience with Samsung. I have been using this mobile from last 24 days.
From day 2 onwards this mobile start giving problem to me. It keeps on restarting itself for every 2 to 3 hours. After 20 days mobile stopped working. Nothing was working, it was only showing some encrypted message. Then I went to the Samsung service center and got repaired. And  I lost all my data, photos, files which I carried from my old phone. This happened just within 20 days of time. I don't know how many time I need to go to service center in future.

Guys before you buy this mobile please make sure that you have service center nearby, please do not trust this mobile, any time it may give hand, please keep file securely and have a back up.

What I liked best about Ye Olde was the variety, they had several cigars at all price points, so if you can't afford to smoke an Opus X, they had plenty of cigars for less than $10.

Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.

Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.

The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.

PROS:
CAMERA - 4.8/5
BATTERY- 5/5
Display - 4.7/5
Performance - 4.8/5
Speed - 5/5
Gaming experience- 4.8/5

CONS
NO Headset jack.
One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.

negative,"Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge:

You might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box.

You might drink far too many pitchers of PBR.

You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only.

The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean it's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesn't take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Don't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, you'll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are.

I like to dine at local places like this, particularly those that make their drink mixes in house and use locally sourced food [when possible].

The drinks I had were great: Aloe Arizona, The Kingston Rum Punch and Piña Colada Redux

I had a dish with red snapper and vegetables; which was excellent. I had rice and peas on the side, the rice was not the best however; it seemed too dry.
My friend had the prawns, I did not taste it, but the presentation looked good. She also had the coconut water which was served in a coconut - it was great and she mentioned it complimented the prawn dish.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.

positive,"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.

The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.

The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own.",2

Yet.

Let me explain.

1) Rose & Crown - The Hours. If it is really meant to be a British pub and a new asset to downtown nightlife, it needs to strongly declare A) YES! WE ARE OPEN! and B) YES! WE ARE OPEN *LATE*! When you're turned away when you excitedly show up at midnight on a Saturday because they decided to close for whatever reason, you're not going to be too excited about trying to go back the next time. What's a British pub doing closing so early? I went out of my way to go here, to experience this new bar and enjoy its offerings, and was sent packing. Meh. So I was surprised when a bunch of Yelpers decided to make it a meetup spot a few weeks later. Well, maybe this time, at 10:30, we'd be more fortunate with it staying open. 

And we were. Rock on.

2) Rose & Crown - The Setting. I gather that the business owners are extremely limited with how much they can change with the house since it's probably a landmark with stringent regulations on how much of the interior can be changed, but since I've eaten at Circa 1900 a number of times before it vacated the premises, walking in here felt exactly the same. Sitting at the EXACT same 4-top table I ate before. The room hadn't changed one iota when it came to layout or furniture. Even the angles the tables were placed at. That was a little odd. The only main changes in the front west room were the giant visages of the Queen and good ol' Winston glaring down at you. In any case, it was kind of hard for me to make the mental transition from ""this is a sit-down restaurant"" to a ""this is going to be your local English pub"" when it comes to the indoors. Was it nice? Definitely. It's really nice inside. But pubby? No. That said, the front balcony is a really great location to hang out on, and I can imagine how great it'll be around springtime. But the balcony's more an asset of the great old house itself. 

3) Rose & Crown - The offerings. Standard selection of beers, including good ol' English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap. Food menu not too big, but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing, so I ordered those. I was skeptical, but to my surprise, the fish was great, as was their spin on the tartar sauce. Fries were also tasty, but fries are fries, and I'm going to devour them anyway because I was crazy hungry. But all in all, thumbs up on the food.

4) Rose & Crown - The service. Was kind of there but more present at the beginning and then invisible near the end when were ready to leave, thus having to go back inside, tell the bar manager what we ordered since he didn't have the bill, and then pay him instead of our server. Kind of odd.

So all in all, as I said already, 3.67 stars. I'm definitely willing to go back there and be open to editing my review and increasing its star wattage, but for now, it hasn't completely won me over. Definitely has a lot of promise, with its abundance of Britpop playing and proximity to Bianco, the sporting venues, ASU, etc., but they need to work on being consistently open late before I think about making this one of my definite go-to institutions.",2

I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.

Face Id: opens with photo too
Fingerpring Id: works in multiple attempts
Camera: wide angle is adding two image from 2 cameras. Half images stays straight, half goes bended.
Battery : No doubt its 5000 mAh so works good but not best.
Charging: Fast charge is a myth for this phone.
Screen: you can hardly read anything in Sunlight.
Processor: I don't know why Samsung teied Exynos, snapdragon and kirin are much much faster than this.
Touch: Touch stops working and suddenly performs all action which you do when it stops working.
Most Important, PUBG: Dont even think to play Pubg with this. I stopped playing pubg on this phone at the end. Hangs a lot. Heats after 1 game.
Network: internet works good only when on Wifi. Tried in different places with different networks.

[Amuse bouche]
I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp. Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks.

[Appetizer]
Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning.
Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me.
Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor.

[Entree]
Halibut - Best dish in recent memory! Get this. Just do it.
Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef. The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy.

[Dessert]
Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious. The rest of it was okay.

After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view. We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster. Oh well!

The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert. Two thumbs up!

Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside. Woohoo!",2

positive,"100% satisfaction with this phone thus far! Love the design, the performance, Oxygen OS, it's a whole lot better than what my previous phone in Samsung was. Doesn't heat up at all, never lags or hangs.

With that being said it's early days I'm hoping it stands the test of time and it's only been about a month of usage, but thus far I'm loving every second of it.

Battery usage lasts for between 8 and half to 10 hours of screen on time usage and generally lasts for the 24 hours for a heavy user like me. Generally charges from nearly empty to a 100 in a little less than an hour. Charges to 90 in about 50 minutes and to 70 in little over half an hour.

Not a huge camera user but from what I have used of it I'm satisfied with it. Phones like Pixel would obviously be better in that department but it wouldn't let you down. This is probably the only area where it's not flagship level. Otherwise it feels premium in almost every other way.",2

Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!

I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.

negative,"For a layman this phone is an absolute waste. My criteria for buying the phone were
- A good charge holding through a day
-Ease of taking photos
-Ease of usage of messaging and other apps
The phone heats ups at the slightest of use and the I keep getting alerts that the phone temperature has been stabilised
The charge of the phone will barely last you until noon with maybe about 10 calls
background apps keep running even if you dont need. The ease of getting around the settings is cumbersome.
If you open a video on whatsapp it dissappears into the back and only audio will keep playing. so embarassing when a call comes in
You cant silence the ring when the background video is playing

Miss Nondrifty appears out of nowhere, & I ask her about it.  She agrees with me that it's not on the menu, & says they have Vegetable Soup & Broccoli Cheese Soup.  Fine, but I'm a meatie!  (Ok, the Broccoli Cheese is good, but I at least wanted Chicken Noodle which almost all Subways have every day.)

After receiving my sandwich (& skipping the soup), I put my cup under the ice dispenser & it was empty!  I gripe & in a few minutes Mr. Drifty III appears & pours a bag of ice into the soda dispenser.  We're at 2 Stars right now, including a boost for the clean, comfortable cafe atmosphere & nice booth to sit in.

Ok, the good:

Backtracking to just after the no soup/soup/no soup minute, & placing my order...   The place is a little busy, but it's not too long a wait for Mr. Drifty II to go to work on my sandwich.  I order a ""Subway Melt"" which comes with ham, turkey, bacon, your choice of cheese, & whatever veggies you want on it.  

I get it on their Honey Oat bread, & have him not toast it, but just nuke the four long slices of raw bacon.  The bread gets a thin coating of mustard on one side & mayonnaise on the other.  For cheese, it gets Pepper Jack (of several good choices), then a little lettuce, lots of tomato, some onion, Greek Pepper slices, & a squirt of Ranch Dressing.

OMG, it was terrific!!  ...and the October Special is ANY foot long sub  (except 2) for only $5!

SO, while this Subway doesn't come up to the 5 Star one down the street at 5130 W. Baseline, the great sandwich & value propelled this one up to 4 Stars (& I didn't need the soup anyway)!     :-))",2

Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup. 

The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch.

On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM.

So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Don't eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup.

The sweet potatoes fries are always really good side. 

Now some friends have had some bad experiences with service. They have a hard time returning. It happens, esp. when it is first Friday or when the host staff is out of their minds, there is just an inconsistency there. But don't let that ruin the tone of the meal.

This phone is too fragile, as I have learned the painfully expensive way!
The fell off just 2 feet above the ground and the screen broke along with damage to charging point, cost me over 7000/- INR to get it working again.

Pros:
->Good Battery
->Samsung OneUI Andriod 9 Pie (Updated)
->lots of RAM, won't slow anything
->Gaming Performance: You would play all games @ Low to Medium settings
->Doesn't Heat up even if used heavily for long duration

positive,"The brand has delivered once again. I have been using the OnePlus 7 before this. But the 7T is not just an incremental upgrade. It has much more to it. Let's start with a few key differences between the OnePlus 7 and 7T
1) The vibration motor has now haptic feedback. Much better than linear motor on op 7 and almost similar to OP7 Pro. I love it.
2) The phone is slimmer and has a better feel in hand though bigger but has a more sharp corners which adds decency in contrast to rounded corners on OP7. Also notch size is reduced.
3) the cameras. Well everyone knows about the cameras. I would like to say that the macro lens that uses the ultrawide lens, is not just a gimmick. It can take photos of fabrics that even the eyes cannot see.
4) the smoothness of 90hz screen is just really good to experience.
5) The antutu benchmark score. 400000 in comparison to 370000 of oneplus.
6) the dual speakers. The ear piece speaker has now higher volume than bottom speaker. On the 7 it was opposite. Also 7t's sound is slightly richer than 7.
7) Well the warp charge 30T really adds up. It charges the phone from 0 to 67 in 30 mins. And 0 to 100 in 61 mins. Saves a lot of time. Whereas the 7 takes 86 mins.
8) it comes pre installed with Android 10. So 2 Android updates are guaranteed. Whereas 7 came with Pie. Most likely to get an update less.

Well now the cons:
1)I got a little defective piece. The screen adhesive was slightly visible on left hand side. So opted for a replacement.
2)  The wifi sometimes disconnects and thrn reconnects on its own. Maybe a software issue. OnePlus might fix it soon.

Well got it for 36k from Amazon. A must buy phone. Cannot keep myself from recommending. Kudos to OnePlus.",2

This is old school Mexican food folks and it's about as good as it gets. The atmosphere is classic and I personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale  but then again Mexican food normally isn't.

A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host, Michael.  It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place, without the attitude and pompous feel.  The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant.  The drinks are creative.  And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.

I'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.  I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.

Prices are very reasonable.  This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.  As it is now, you can just walk in.

neutral,"Five Guys offers a decent burger, but it's definitely overcooked--they brag about serving them well done and there's no argument here: that's what they are. But I much prefer the flavor of Smashburger's meat. Five Guys seemed rather devoid of meaningful seasoning, or if it was there, it was killed in the well-doneing. 

I also didn't really like that it comes out as two carelessly charred mini-patties, instead of one, nicely cooked and seasoned burger.

As far as Mill-area burgers are concerned, I'm at the following:
1.Smashburger  2. Chuckbox 3.  In N Out 4. Five Guys 5. Fatburger

And Chuckbox and Smashburger are awfully close. I've been a HUGE fan of Chuckbox for forever, so many I like the newness of Smashburger, but damn is it tasty. I also prefer the Smashfries to Chuckbox's fries, but I think I prefer 5 Guys' fries to both of them.

Finally, the price is obnoxious. You're not getting that much in the way of a burger for $11 (drink + fries + cheeseburger). You get a MOUNTAIN of fries, but I don't NEED that many fries. You also get to top it with just about anything, but I don't want to subsidize other people's toppings. Let me pay $2 less to get mine with lettuce, ketchup, and mayo.

Overall a meh burger. Not great, but better than Fatburger, if I don't want to walk to College for great burgerness.

Oh, as for atmosphere, it was like a club in there. I really don't need to be bombarded with music at lunch when I'm going to talk to someone. I hate shouting and the few times when the song would switch and the grill would quiet was like the eye of the storm. Turn that shit down.",1

neutral,"While the idea is not new - an updated outdoor shopping center that mimics a European outdoor shopping and residential district, Kierland Commons is similar to West Village in Dallas, TX or Santana Row in Santa Clara, CA, however, in the Scottsdale version, it is completely stripped of any personality and design, perhaps to better blend in with the desert environment.

The usual suburban chain stores can be found at this shopping center, ranging from Smith and Hawken, Banana Republic, Barnes & Noble and the like, though there are a select few independent retailers which make a trip to this center a little more interesting.  Parking can be difficult, however, there are lots that line the backside of the center as well as valet parking across from the center park.  People watching is quite entertaining, from the kiddies that frolick in the fountains, to Barbie's desert siblings.

The independent dining options are a little more interesting, such as The Green House and Zinc Bistro, though again, the usual unimaginative chains are represented here, including PF Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory.  

While I don't find most of the retail offerings at Kierland Commons to be particularly compelling to make multiple repeat visits, I will return for the more independent dining options.",1
negative,"I bought this phone a month back with lot of expectations and enthusiasm since I already owned OnePlus 3 and was very happy with the phone. But all that enthusiasm and expectations died down within 3 weeks, since my screen got damaged in an unusual way. The phone offers 90Hz Refresh rate with a very good display but at the cost of a risky design. I see this as a design / manufacturing issue which one plus is not ready to accept.

The worst part is the Customer Support team and Servify (One Plus Care team) teams who are very unprofessional and change their stance every minute. I was initially told that the screen will be replaced since it was just 3 weeks after purchase. Later I was told to purchase a 1 year Accidental protection plan which I did at additional cost. After purchasing this plan they said, I will not be covered for various reasons and the plan will be no more valid. I had to wait for one week with multiple calls and then shell out 12,000/- Rs from my pocket to get the screen replaced. The Ad says Screen Protection (Pre-filled)...god only knows what this means. I am duped really with the worst customer service team of One plus.

Yes while the phone is very attractive with lot of great features...do not forget the quote ""All that glitters is not Gold"". Keep this in mind before you shell out 35+ k to buy this phone.

My only hope now is Amazon since I have reported the issue to them and hope they will do something to reduce the pain I went through.",0

I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied. 

The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick. 

The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia.",2

1. There is a known multi touch issue with this device when you put 2 fingers and then introduce a third finger near the first two even after  moving away 3 touch points the third one remains intact means it is ghost touch.

2. Phone display is of cheap quality considering for how much this phone was sold originally when it was manufactured (Dec 2018) , when typing it gives serious lag because touch is faulty you will notice it if you try to type faster and this issue is even recognised by Alvin Tse on twitter but since it is hardware issue it can't be solvef through OS updates.

3. Battey Drainage. The phone battery drains very quickly for being a 4000 mAh, you can found this issue too mentioned and recognised many times in Miui forum. Still after all the updates no fix is there. It is annoying.

2) Finger reader: Good( It is on the back side of the phone. Bit inconvient to use and you end up using lame 1234 pinlock😂🤣)
3) Camera: China ka Maal😂( I dont know which lens or megapixels they are using and i don't even care. It is way behind the league, iphone users you can definately trust me on that😜)

With an awesome mix of Old School Funk, Reggae, Classic Rock, and even a little Santana action, the live band was ON POINT! We were singing and dancing to every song! The crowd was fairly diverse and everyone was friendly. I could definitely see this as a relaxing place to go after a long day, where you don't necessarily have to wear ""club attire"" to fit in. The vibe was very chill and the drinks were great. I'll definitely be coming to Char's the next time I'm in town.

positive,"I grew up at Word of Grace (now City of Grace). Way before the new buildings and it just the small little church. I love Pastor Gary. I would give him 5 stars. We moved but I had always considered this my home church. When we moved back to AZ I started again and was really disappointed with the young adults ministry and praise and worship. I left when I wasn't getting anything out of it and not much longer did they join with City Church. I think they are struggling but I have hope for them. Pastor Terry is the new head pastor and he has the Joel Osteen vibe, which isn't for me, but he is very nice. 

They are non- denominational and love their congregation enough to handle sins or situations other churches don't want to touch in fear of being labeled as 'haters' or what not. I hope that anyone who attends will understand their views do not come from hate. It makes me sad that the other reviewer had such a negative experience and I don't doubt that she wasn't treated with kindess as every church seems to have those rude people. I am not sure what she means by 'closed-minded' but I know there are people like that at every church. I hope others do not have that experience and I hope the church can work on that as a whole. people need to feel welcome and accepted as they are. 

They are also awesome with the community- homeless outreaches, drug addiction help, and so many things I cannot begin to list. If you ever want to help your community City of Grace would be a great place to get ideas of where/how you can help. 

 If pastor Terry isn't for you I would recommend Cornerstone Chandler(my home church) or Central Christian. They are not closed-minded but they also won't ignore sins that are major issues. IE divorce, porn, sex, sexuality, infedility, etc.  Good luck on finding your home church!!",2

I just picked up an phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.
Talking about this phone, this comes with normal battery life and I can stream all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. I already have 200 plus photos in my phone
The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)",2

positive,Oneplus gives you premium quality phones in Android. Camera is best. Battery life is okay lasts for whole day but on very heavy work need to charge. Charging is just awesome 45min whole phn is charged. Bulit quality is pretty good. If you are thinking for android go for oneplus rather than expensive note phones. Oneplus always gives you update on time to time so no worry that your phone become old. I used oneplus 6 till it is getting updates. Unfortunately i lost it. I trust oneplus so again going for it. Oneplus is best for android no one can beat it. Really happy with my new oneplus 7t😀😀,2

neutral,"Wowza!  This place is a total trip!  No, I don't smoke, but if I did this place is probably the place I would go to.  

First off, the food was okay.  I ordered some chicken wings, which wasn't really that great.  My favorite was the Thai Curry -- it definitely had some pop to it.  It's one of those that creep up on you.  Milk please!  My friend ordered some Sake that I thought was real good and smooth -- don't ask me what it was, the lighting was low and I didn't care much by the time I arrived.

Service was pretty good I guess, and then again the place was drop dead for a Friday night.  What's up with that!?  I'm sure the place gets hopping on 1st Friday, but that's only one day out of the month -- I sure it picks up quick!

Ambience, was cool, just reminded me of the 70's in a way even though I didn't grow up during the 70's haha, but I thought the design and decor were pretty cool.  Eccentric I think was the word I used.  Bathroom was blue and that's all I'll say.......check it out! - Enjoy!",1

Camera quality is too good. Specially the 32 MP selfie camera is just a beast.

Battery optimization is not that good.

One thing that attracts me is that the size of the phone. It is compact enough, you can use in one hand comfortably.

Runs smoothly.

Got Android 10 update just yesterday.
Its good.

Stock android experience is good enough. But misses some featured phone facilities of MIUI at the same time.

Display quality is good enogh. You can not find out any drawback of 720p at all.

One main drawback is that, the monthly updates are given too late. They provide it in the last weak of the month.

Also the android 10 they have given in March 2020, where Nokia devices got that update probably in last november.

XIAOMI R&D team is just useless.
They put there whole brain in feature phones.

Also, the Xiaomi official made some fake promises like they will give android 10 update first in MI A3.

No lag till date.

P. S: I am not a gamer. 😑

I will recommend you to buy Nokia Stock Android phones for their better service.

Only you can go for MI A3 if you want excellent camera.",1

positive,"Here's a review of the phone after a week's usage:
The phone looks great and is a sweet deal considering the price point. Xiaomi has made a few improvements like putting a fast charger in the box. The phone has been running smooth so far and performing well as far as gaming is concerned. Here are the features:

1. Awesome design- the phone looks good and the color scheme is fresh. The water drop notch looks good and the bezels are pretty sleek. The fingerprint reader is smaller as well.
2.  Display - The FHD+ display has 2340*1080 resolution, the color reproduction is good and viewing angles are nice. Sharpness levels are okay I would say.
3. Performance - The Snapdragon 655 processor with Adreno 610 GPU does a very smooth job as far as using the apps are concerned. I never faced a lag or a stutter so far. The MIUI is as usual and I have never personally liked it. Let's hope the MIUI11 rollout makes things better. Gaming experience is decent and not very great. But considering the price , the expectations weren't that high.
4. Camera - Camera does a decent job. At this price point , the front camera is outperforming. The rear camera does a decent job as well. It could have been better though.  The ultrawide lens serves its purpose. But comparing it with other phones under 20k, they all do a similar job.
5. Battery - The battery lasts a full day with above moderate usage that includes browsing social media for 1-2 hours, streaming videos for 3-4 hours, using WhatsApp web for 8-9 hours. The device takes around one hour to get from 20% to 80%.

Verdict - The phone looks good, performs well and takes decent pictures. It's a total value for money and would prove to be  a good competitor in the mid range segment.",2

I had to ask for a cold glass to put it in and when I was served the 2nd one, they didn't include it. I had to ask again.

The food:  Pretty good, actually. However, its totally overpriced and the portions are pretty small. So it makes the hurt on the wallet that much more severe.  Our waitress was cool, she put up with a lot of conversations in our group, sometimes being loud and not paying attention.

Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight.

All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.

Well I'm from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joe's.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.

-SOFTWARE:8.5/10
The new OneUI 2.0 built on Android 10 is superb and user friendly..Also it has some good features

-DISPLAY:9/10
The 6.4inch amoled display  with full-HD+ is good...It supports Widevine L1 to which is awesome..The details were richer compared to other mobiles in this price segment

-BATTERY:10/10
The massive 6000mah is pretty good and it lasts upto 1.5 days for a normal user .Charging from 0-75% is good with 15W charger but after it takes a long time to reach 100% ..
Total time taken (0-100%) is 2.5 hrs..

-SOUND:9/10
The sound is decent..it has richer tone and no distortion at high volumes...The Dolby Atmos supports only with Earphones  but it was excellent. Call quality was good..

-CAMERA:7.5/10
As this model is just an upgraded version of m30s,it is just have been improved...The pics came out well in daylight..dynamic range was pretty decent....But video stabilization and photos at low light was not upto the mark..Macro was okayish...The front camera was okay ..But overall good..

-It is not suitable  for high graphics  gaming...
Overheating is not there...I suggest Samsung  to upgrade  the chipset in the future
-Fingerprint reader is very fast
-Phone is slippery..I suggest you to buy a good case for it.",2

Because,This is good phone in mid range and when you keep in hand you feels premium comparative to other brands.
From the day I buy this phone I have no problem to handle it because it runs very smoothly.
》The key specifications of Samsung M20 are:
1)Sharp, crisp display
2)Good battery life
3)Up-to-date specifications
4)And you get regular software updates from samsung.",2

positive,Best phone in this range . Having the best battery life . 5000 mAh is something. Playing games on this phone is the best feeling. It has good storage with good camera Making my photos come live . Has a clear and crisp screen.,2
neutral,"Plenty has already been spoken about hardware and specs so no point getting into that. This is a user centric review

Face and fingerprint unlock is good.

Funtouch OS is childish and cluttered. Lot of settings are provided just for the sake of being 'different' but the overall effect ends up being counter intuitive - for example swiping up for screenshot rather than down. Taking a long screenshot and/ or creating a split screen is unnecessarily complicated with requirement of more taps rather than being a simple affair as in other OS skins. Swiping up for accessing control center shortcuts is an irritant as it sometimes brings up the 'recent apps' screen or the 'docked apps' if using a custom launcher.

The camera UI can do with a complete makeover and as such is rudimentary compared to other mobiles! The only saving grace is that the cam2api is compatible with open camera which bestows more control over the photography. The camera and sensor performance is at par with mobiles of this price point category.

No complaints with the screen, system performance and battery charging/ backup.

Phone self test feature is missing.

The updates (have received one update so far) install without change log information - go figure!!!

A major point of angst is the misleading paid reviews which claimed the Phone has FM radio. However, in actual fact the phone does not ship with the FM radio chip (Also confirmed from the support staff, who - just to mention - were found to be clueless regarding the difference between an internet FM radio and actual terrestrial FM radio. They kept insisting to install any FM app from google play store - Go figure!!!

All in all a mixed bag - some good - rest mostly just hype!!! In my personal opinion, such a mobile is overpriced at this price point even with the deals thrown in. Would probably avoid patronizing Vivo products in future!",1

She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. 

She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.

The ginormous chunks of cod with a crispy, light-to-medium batter is very tasty. I prefer it with the scalloped potatoes but you don't get a choice during Friday all-you-can-eat.

It's a small-to-medium sized pub with a nice scotch and whiskey menu. I had my first Tullamore Dew here and it didn't disappoint. It's a bit dark and some of the tables are wine barrels - makes comfortable sitting a bit of a challenge. The live bands I've heard were great and can be pretty loud.

I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.

I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.

Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.

Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints here

Camera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality",0

Dr. Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism. I am very thankful that my ""second opinion"" quest led me to him.

positive,"Outstanding product.

Pros:
1. Outstanding rear and front cameras. Pics attached using all modes night mode pro mode 48mp cam, night mode and macro mode
2. Top battery. 4000 maH Lithium Polymer battery gives the necessary backup for essential activities. For a non gamer like me, battery runs close to two days with moderate internet usage. For heavy gamers and high internet usage users, battery will last one full day.
3. Very few ads on the MiUI 10 which is a big relief. Plus they can be turned off as well.
4. Stable Android 9 with a possibility of Android 10 uodate. MiUI is pretty stable too.
5. Loads of storage space around 110 GB free space out of 128 GB. You can literally full up your mobile and use this this like a mini hard disk.
6. Powerful 6 GB RAM. Multitasking is pretty simple and I have tested this personally by opening 15 apps in congruence. The performance did not come down even one bit.
7. Inbuilt RAM cleaner and security scan check. New apps are automatically scanned for viruses.
8. Great camera with a variety of features including slow motion video (1080p) macro mode night mode 48 MP mode pro mode potrait mode with depth focus. Shots are clear and crisp. Good night mode shots illustrated in the pics.
9. Gorilla glass 5 on both sides of the phone to protect fall and both sides smooth finish. This is an enhancement feature which wasn't present earlier.
10. Fantastic Snapdragon 665 processor with a decent 100000+ Antutu score. Excellent for daily usage and good for gaming.
11. Great 6+ inch display perfect for normal day to day use.
12. No issue of heating encountered until now in 15 days of usage.
13. 18 watt fast charging makes the phone go from 0 to 100 charger in less than an hour which is simply brilliant.

Cons:

1. Battery would be a downfall for gamers as it drains faster on gaming.
2. Snapdragon 665 might not be the accurate choice for gaming. Helio processor on the Redmi  note 8 pro is a true gaming beast.
3. Selfie camera of 13 MP has limited options. Only HD and AI to be specific. Could have provided multiple options on the front cam or enhanced it's quality but for 13k this is a killer deal.
4. Ads in the interface can be irritating for new users.
5. Phone gets heated on charging which I guess is pretty normal for any phone.

Go for it. It will not disappoint you. Best budget phone.",2

negative,"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.

Getting such a huge screen at this price is all we ever asked for!!
Full screen of the mobile gives out a joy for using it. Then comes the vibrant colours! The colours of the different beautiful wallpaper looks amazing! There is a huge range of options for wallpapers too!
Phones are very necessary for today’s generation hence choosing a good phone was important and I guess I did a great job by choosing a wonderful phone like M20

It comes in two classy colours!
Infinity display is my favourite part of the phone.
Battery is also good as it comes with 5000mah battery
It also gets charged very fast 3x
It comes with 4gb ram with freaking 64gb internal
It’s also a dual sim phone the way everyone needs in nowadays business life
Now comes the best part! And that camera!
One and all needs a good camera this phone satisfies that need in a really really good manner!!!
It’s a dual camera!
It also comes with front flash! Say hello to night selfies!

Due to diwali leave Samsung closed.  When service center open i reach there and it is prooved that phone screen is defect due to manufacturing side.  I had requested to change but they show me the 15 day policy but it was diwali holiday but they don't understand to replace phone and provide me only screen change option. Here device had manufacturing defect but amazon and Samsung both not replaced me my phone. Zero customer approach. From my side say no to amazon and Samsung now. I had seen so many people in service center having similar issues like me. No care for customer one shop near me help ne even after 6 month in my previous phone issue and replace the phone. So go to near by shop.",0

positive,"This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again.",2

3.The display is top notch , its quite gud and colorful.

5. The performance is quite gud. Although, samsung Exynos was used. There was many critics who wished for Snapdragon,  but for daily use it runs well.

The only problem i hv come across is heating. Its not over heating, just little increase in temperature.  This happens only while playing high spec games like PUGB. It is not problem , just mentioned it just in case.

I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, ""chicken fried rice, right?"" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.

Or at least their version of it.

I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.

Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.

I'll just list a few things that irk me:
I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG!
Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone.
The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW!
I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!

Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.

This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two. 

I had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.

Great value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait.",2
negative,Scuzy waiter. Scuzy manager. Overall just a bad experience. The food was pretty awful too. I don't understand how this place is so successful! The food was either waaaay over-seasoned of severely under-seasoned. A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant can produce better Chinese food. And at cheaper prices. Search around. It'll be well worth it.,0

Few minutes of camera usage and battery heats up.  16mp Selfi camera  does not contain zoom in and out feature and most important 48mp camera clicks looks like ordinary, no details.  Eye start paining after few hours of usage.  Even screen of this device is having some defect, pale yellowish even when set to vivid and cool in configuration. One can see the difference in image.

positive,"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out!

I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try!

I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene. 

I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing!

I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.  

I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs' ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful!

All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites!

I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!",2

2. OS is friendly.
3. Performance is as of now good for average usage.
4. A very well try from Samsung, but needs a whole lot of improvement if they want to dominate the mid range segment.

Cons...
1. Camera .... Totally wasted. If u love mobile photography ... Plz dont buy this phone.
2. Heating issue during photography and gaming.
3. GPU is not upto the mark as compared to Adreno series.
4. Build quality... Dose not feel like a mid range premium phone. Chinese makers are far ahead in this or below this price range.
5. Hd fon audio o/p and normal speaker o/p has been compromised.
6. Gaming experience is poor as compared to SD processors within this price range.
7. The battery backup has been over hyped.
8. Some one ... In the name of Samsung India, here in Amazon Q&A section, was claiming the front glass was CG 3, but latter found it is dragon tail glass, nowhere in the competition. Amazon, plz take care of this matter. Don't fool the customers.

Verdict ...
Go for any chinese manufacturers within this price range having SD cheapest...

My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).
This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. 

We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. 
To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.",0

Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.

Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.

Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?

Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.

Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.

Other worthy options: 
Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!

Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!

Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.

Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!

Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.

Empanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.

Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.

Flan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.

Free Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!

As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one.

After sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.

The service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.

I would definitely return but hope the service is better.",2

positive,"I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I haven't stopped coming back. The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes. A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito. Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side. 

For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy). There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!

There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables). The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)

Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to. Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home. The best thing about Karey's Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley!",2

positive,"Please read my review carefully. First two lines following this line were my review feedback after using the product for couple of days and the rest are added today (4th Sep 2019).

Much waited product. Camera awesome  battery lasts for 3 days for normal use. Superb display. Watched Amazon prime videos in full screen mode and simply it rocks. Fluidic performance.

My Review after using the product for more than 5 months:

Guys, I picked this phone after a thorough research and the tough competitor was Redmi Note 7 Pro. But Samsung won due to the careless fabrication, finishing and assembling of Redmi Phones. You will be first hijacked with lot of positive reviews. But remember, never ignore even one negative feedback. So, I was not bowled out by the higher resolution camera offered by other brand but chosen the quality over other stuff.  Let me come to the points.

PROS:

BUILD QUALITY: Never experienced any hanging or heating issues. Awesome Fluidic SAMOLED display.
CAMERA: Great photos are so easy to snap. Look at my samples. I am not a professional photographer and I am totally convinced with what M30 can do for me.
BATTERY: Whenever I take my car for long rides with 450+ KM distance for 7+ hours M30 always stayed with enough power to use GPS. It was the feat I was always wanted in a phone.
PERFORMANCE: 4GB RAM is enough for me to install all my needed apps and the phone is flawless. Apart from the built-in 64 GB RAM, I have added 128 GB SD Card. I will never delete a single file for couple of years.
SOUND: The voice quality, speaker volume and DOLBY ATMOS support are really great. We won't get this from cheap mid-range competitor phones or even from the closely competing phones.
MAINTENANCE: Samsung provided the OS upgrade to Android 9 with One UI 1.1. Security patches are released frequently.

CONS:
Though I am convinced with the camera output, I want Samsung to provide better camera with improved low light and dark scene support.

Overall it is a great phone.",2
negative,Battery & display is good... other than that there is nothing with this phone ... Both rear & front camera very pathetic ... & some times network issue ... and it takes 2 better go for m30,0
positive,"I recently visited Olive and Ivy for business last week, and after 3 visits, I am convinced that Fox Restaurants has some of the best establishments in the valley.  Olive and Ivy is the Fox Restaurant of choice for consistently good food, great drinks, and most of all, outstanding service.  I spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants.  Not Olive and Ivy.  From the first phone call for reservations, to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross, this restaurant knows how to make you feel special.

Many of the reviews here will focus on the food and I could spend hours talking about my experiences but I will sum it up in a couple of my favorites. 

I hate dates and prunes, but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good!
The shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes I have tasted since arriving in Phoenix 3 years ago.  And hands down, their short rib entree is best in the valley.

The only catch is the cost.  Olive and Ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date.  With wine, apps, and main course, you will easy break the century mark, and if you are really being generous, $200 is obtainable.  But, it's worth every dollar and who knows, you may even get breakfast out of the deal!",2
positive,Awesome phone. It's display is not much good. And brightness of phone also not as much as other phones have.,2
negative,"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!",0

Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.

We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.

Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.

I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends (notice, I didn't say ""my"" friends) and I've always been curious.  Errand days are kinda ho-hum anyway, so I was excited to finally check this place out.  The reason I order a doughnut that is stripped off glaze and topping is that I'd  like to taste the actual product. 

Two doughnuts for my little guy and me for $1.60.  As the girl handed me the paper bag I was extra careful handling it for nothing.  Cold doughnuts?  Am I just so used to piping hot beignets?    Right off the first bite, I could feel the cheap hydrogenated oils coating the roof of my mouth.  Then the second bite, the feeling is now in my throat.  Eeek!  I asked my son what he thought.  ""It's okay,""  he stared at the doughnut and looked up at me.  I grab his doughnut and along with mine threw both in the paper bag it came with and chucked it.   Honestly, it would have been better to fry these sinful things in lard.  There is something about chemically laden food that I despise most!

Would I give it a second chance?  Not until they change their frying oil!

positive,"The three of us ate at Famous Dave's last evening and had a really nice time! 

We stopped in around 5:30 or so and were seated at a booth in the bar area. It was still early, so there was plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. Our server came by a few moments after we were seated and asked about our drink order. Nice. 

If you have never been to a Famous Dave's, it's sort of like a Texas Roadhouse, which is a complement. I've had some really good BBQ over the years in local Roadhouses throughout the US, and clearly this chain has copied the model. 

We started with some onion strings and chicken tenders off the Happy Hour menu along with our drinks. Both were good, but ordinary. What made them good was Dave's sauce. At each table you have five or six choices, as well as the sauce that came from the kitchen. 

For dinner we order a Pulled-Pork sandwich with sides, a large BBQ Huli platter and some Texas steak tips grande nachos. Each was delicious and large enough that we couldn't finish. One observation on portions, they are large -- like two Styrofoam take home boxes large 

For dessert we order some $1.98 mini puddings and brownies. Just the right size for everyone after a large dinner. 

Fellow Yelper Scott D put it best in his 7/23/10 review: ""Famous Dave's consistently delivers no matter which location you go to"". Our party of three heartily agrees! 

The tab came to $69.49, including taxes but without tip. We thought that was fair given the serving size and the tastiness of the food. We will be back! 

Enjoy!",2

negative,"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... 

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back.",0

neutral,"Good, fresh chinese food, a little pricey.

There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. 

Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).

Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. 

The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream. 

The only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream.

The service was great, very polite and friendly waiters.",1

negative,"Though I am a big fan of Redmi Note series phones and have been using since Note 2 4G time. But this time it disappointed me a lot because of very poor audio quality and the issue with the grip of the phone. Camera quality could have been better although its a 64 mega pixel but quality id very bad. I think Xioami needs to rethink on their strategy of quickly producing various models just to be in the market. Rather they should focus on stability in the market by providing quality product by taking good time to design, develop and market.

positive,"Lo Lo's is pretty much what you'd expect a place focusing on ""Chicken & Waffles"" to be. Small, lively, full of smiling people all eating, well......chicken and waffles. The line out front attests to its popularity. 

After finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Lo's would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire year's worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist. 

We had a short wait for our table, but were able to quench our thirst on soft drinks, punch, and sweet tea. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to love it. 

I am a big fan of chicken. I am a big fan of waffles. Yet, I have never had them together. Thus, I decided the only choice for me was their No. 1 Meal, called KK's. Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. 

The food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big ""fried chicken"" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home. 

Lo Lo's is one of those experiences that should not be missed. But, make sure to clear your afternoon and, just to be safe, you may want to consult a health professional.",2

positive,"Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....

Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.

Pros:
Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.

As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.

Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.

In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.

The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.

I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.

Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.

The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.

Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.

Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.

Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.

The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.

The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.

The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.

Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.

Cons:
Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.

There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.

The Camera software is not optimized yet.

Battery life can be an issue for some users.

The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.",2

positive,Fingerprint reader is literally quite slow. In display fingerprints are usually slow and serve no other purpose. Where as physical fingerprint serve as slider to navigate web pages and other contents. Battery life is awesome just bcoz of 720 p display and amoled screen. 720 p display doesn't bother of you're just a light user. You'll notice minor flaws in daylight but in night light it looks much better than 1080p lcd display,2

negative,"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok. 
This is a never return place for us. 
And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.
The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good.",0

Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.  I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.  

I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.  

After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away. She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.

I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future.",2

Built quality - 10/10 with fine detailed finishing and sturdy device. Waterdrop notch i like it personally. But does not have notification lights(i personally prefer to have it).

Camera - quality has improved drastically after latest update. Images are too good just loved it. Can be improved with some ar stickers and stuff to add fun element in camera.

Android 10 OS - OS is a bit buggy where application and touch hangs abrubtly and issue is intermittent but definitely annoying, as least you would you expect is smooth experience with software part after paying 39999₹ for the device. I think one plus have pushed android 10 bit early just for releasing updated oneplus 7t phone. They might resolve the issue with software upgrades.

Sound - 10/10 Experience is very good with and without headphones. Phone comesnwith dual speaker and provides truly stereo effect.

Battery - 7/10
Battery charging is very quick with warp charging but it drains thatbquickly as well with minimal usage. It hardly lasts for me upto 20-24 hours(which i say is less from my past exp with other phones having similar battery capacity and non amoled display)

Display - 10/10 You will definitely fall in love with the amoled display and video viewing experience is simply superb.",2

M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino. $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, such as 1/2 lb. burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc. don't order the fish chilli though, it tastes like A1 sauce. they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc.



happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget. BUZZKILL.",2

We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. 

We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. 

Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.",0
neutral,"Cave Creek is a well-manicured muni, featuring a straight-forward layout, nice practice area and large putting green.  There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall it's a pretty easy course.

Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  

Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars.",1

The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.

1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.) 

2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms) 

3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present.

My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed. We had gone to a different Pancho's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that. The choices were very very limited and basic. There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamale,taco and some horrible tasting enchiladas. How does a Mexican food place not offer burritos...have you guys heard of a bean burrito? Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer.

The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas, which actually were good. Unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay $20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas. 

Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place. Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost.",0

The wait staff are unprofessional and could give 2 rats about your dining experience; but all you have to do is tip accordingly and hopefully they'll shape up.

I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.    

The food is always good.  It is a bar so don't expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I haven't been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold.",2

the ice cream here was very tasty. full of fancy flavors and bits-o-ingredients. but i guess if you want plain ice cream, you go to the supermarket and buy a gallon of store brand. we were cruising the greenbelt at night and saw their sign for ""voted best ice cream"" by the new times, so we decided to hit this place up. it's super cute and modern, but what's so great about this place is the staff. 
our ""server"" was completely into the concept of ""artisan"" ice cream (only in scottsdale can a word like artisan be applied to ice cream...it's not simply ""homemade""). she was super passionate and lively and gregarious, which i really like...because i know she's serving a product she enjoys herself and also wants others to enjoy. 

i had the peach cobbler one and my girl had the basil sorbet. both were very delicious, but at over 6 bucks for 2 small cups, we'll probably have to save our dollars for the supermarket next time. if you have the cash to spare for a snack/dessert, check this place out.",2

positive,"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.

I have to assume it's called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.

Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.

Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...

I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more.",2

It's a BIG bar. There is a more ""game side"" and a more ""table/eating side"". They have a ton of TV's that are large and high quality. I have never seen it ""slow"" here. It seems no matter what the day or time it's pretty happening! 
The food is really good. I love the diverse menu, happy hour specials, and quality ingredients. I also have never once had bad service. The staff is fast, friendly, and has never seemed irritated or overwhelmed. 
There is a large patio out front that you can drink on that has misters and heat lamps (depends on the season).

This location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They've only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  It's also easy to find once you're off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... it's on the right and shares parking with Gold's Gym that is easily seen from the road.

I found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.

Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of ""ham that falls off the bone"" was repeated far too many times.

Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so I'll be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family.",1

neutral,"After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:
1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.
2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.
3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.
4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.
  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.
To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.
Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.",1

Idk how can redmi say that the phone have 48mp camera😔 but the night mode was good and we can't zoom in 48mp camera option & if you're going to buy this phone for camera purpose i Will not suggest you to buy this i (you can better phones in this price like realme 3pro ,redmi note 7s etc.)

-The take-out menu/brochure was worded pretty peculiarly in places.

positive,"The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.

There were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.

Occasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.

Then something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.

Yes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  

Of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm.",2

negative,"I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that I've ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.

I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a ""roasted"" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.

The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.  

While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",0

We had a Living Social deal, and got the sweet potato and regular fries combo, as well as a side salad to start. The fries were good, but nothing special. The salad made me want to cry. I know you don't go to a burger joint to get a salad, but couldn't you at least try to make it a decent salad? It was all white lettuce and a few sprigs of sliced carrots. My husband wanted me to give the place 3 stars for the lettuce alone. But, the burgers themselves were good, and the Build-Your-Own was a really good deal. There is good variety on the toppings, cheese, sauces and buns to choose from. My turkey patty was huge - it was overflowing out of the English muffin. 

Some plusses: the service was really, really excellent. One of the best servers I've ever had. Also, while we were waiting for our table, the owner/manager came around and offered everyone samples of margarita. Since I'm pregnant and couldn't try the sample, he said I got a free milkshake. After we were seated and he was walking around, he made sure our server knew that he had offered a free milkshake and made good on the promise! That was so cool.

🛑 Face look ID is provided but it's useless unlocks the phone even on closed eyes and even if make wierd faces it unlocks it.🤔 But finger print serves the purpose.
🛑 Cameras are poped out to far back cover provided with covers it but if you use any other back cover couldn't cover it properly. So you have be careful with it to avoid scratches at Cameras glass.

✔️ Go for it without any doubt if you want a budget phone for normal use. Bought it in November 2019 reviewing in March 2020, I am using 4+64 version and feels like getting more than enough in 10k. 👍",2
negative,Don't buy this phone at all looks premium but at 13k very low quality. Camera issues came and didnt give options replace after 10 days at mi store. Mi should really put they didnt give warranty.,0

positive,"Excellent 📷 images with 64MP camera 👌
Battery charge lasts easily for full day right now ✌ The mobile is outstanding in this price range and worth every penny. 👍
Coming to No cost EMI, interest is being charged on EMIs other than GST, Which takes away the offered price of 17999 - 10%discount on credit card - No cost EMI discount, which was very attractive at the time of buying",2
negative,"Build quality is poor,
Finger biometric scaner takes time to unlock
Face scanner doesn't work some time.

The only thing I like is battery backup is better because of 5000mah.",0
